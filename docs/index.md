# Platform Overview

<!-- Architecture Overview Diagram: A high-level visualization showing the four main architectural layers (Infrastructure, Platform Capabilities, Shared Product Capabilities, and Applications) with key components in each layer. Lines between components should show major relationships and data flows. -->

Our modern platform leverages healthcare standards like FHIR to create a unified ecosystem where patients, providers, payers, pharmacies, and pharmaceutical manufacturers can collaborate efficiently. By implementing standardized interfaces and event-driven communication, we accelerate time-to-therapy while maintaining secure, compliant data exchange across the medication access landscape.

## Core Platform Components

### FHIR Server
Our FHIR-compliant data repository serves as the canonical source for healthcare information, supporting standardized resource models with complete tagging for security, compliance, and data lineage. The server also provides comprehensive interoperability capabilities through FHIR APIs and robust support for FHIR Implementation Guides, enabling standards-based exchange with healthcare ecosystem partners.

**Supported Standards:** FHIR R4, US Core, DaVinci ePA Implementation Guides, Da Vinci CDex Implementation Guide

```javascript
// Example: Retrieving a patient resource
GET /fhir/Patient/123456
Accept: application/fhir+json
```

### Federated Graph API
The unified API layer exposes capabilities across all systems through a coherent GraphQL interface, enabling product teams to efficiently access data and services while maintaining service boundaries.

```graphql
# Example: Querying patient and medication data
query {
  patient(id: "123456") {
    name { given family }
    medications {
      name
      dosage
      status
    }
  }
}
```

### Event Broker
Our platform uses Confluent Kafka to implement a robust event broker, enabling real-time data processing, system decoupling, and comprehensive visibility into the patient journey.

**Key Event Types:**
- Patient registration events
- Medication access events
- Insurance verification events
- Clinical data updates

### Business Process Management
We plan to implement workflow orchestration for complex healthcare processes, separating business logic from implementation details and enabling efficient process monitoring and optimization. While the specific tool has yet to be decided, we will leverage business process management capabilities to better manage workflows and rules engines.

## Healthcare Capabilities

### Master Data Services
Our robust platform of master data services includes common data sets like medications, providers, pharmacies, payers, patients, and many others. These services enable consistency and reusability of all data available to our products, providing a foundation for reliable decision-making and analytics.

**Key Capabilities:**
- Deterministic and probabilistic patient matching
- Provider directory and organization hierarchy management
- Medication catalog with therapeutic classification
- Payer policies and formulary information

### Forms Management
Structured Data Capture implementation for healthcare forms with Clinical Quality Language integration for auto-population from available patient data.

**Supported Features:**
- Dynamic form rendering from FHIR Questionnaire resources
- Conditional logic and validation
- Auto-population from clinical data
- PDF generation and electronic signatures

### Healthcare Workflows
Implementation of standardized healthcare workflows following established FHIR implementation guides from governing bodies like HL7, Da Vinci, and others. We strive to align with industry standards while delivering value through prior authorization workflows, medication management, and other healthcare processes.

**Supported Implementation Guides:**
- Da Vinci Prior Authorization Support (PAS)
- Da Vinci Coverage Requirements Discovery (CRD)
- HL7 FHIR US Core

## Common Implementation Scenarios
<!-- Scenario Diagram: A sequence diagram showing interactions between key components for a prior authorization workflow, including data flow between systems, event publishing, and API calls. -->

### Prior Authorization Submission

A common implementation scenario involves connecting an EHR system to our prior authorization workflow. This process leverages our FHIR server, event broker, and business process management capabilities to automate and streamline the authorization process.

1. EHR system sends patient and prescription data via FHIR API
2. Platform translates incoming data to canonical FHIR format
3. Events trigger appropriate workflows based on payer and medication
4. Status updates are published via events and accessible through APIs
5. Determinations are returned to EHR with supporting documentation
