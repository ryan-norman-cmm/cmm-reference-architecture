# Platform Overview

<!-- Architecture Overview Diagram: A high-level visualization showing the four main architectural layers (Infrastructure, Platform Capabilities, Shared Product Capabilities, and Applications) with key components in each layer. Lines between components should show major relationships and data flows. -->

Our modern platform leverages healthcare standards like FHIR to create a unified ecosystem where patients, providers, payers, pharmacies, and pharmaceutical manufacturers can collaborate efficiently. By implementing standardized interfaces and event-driven communication, we accelerate time-to-therapy while maintaining secure, compliant data exchange across the medication access landscape.

## Core Platform Components

### Security and Access Framework
Our comprehensive security solution combines Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, and federated identity providers with Okta as the primary IDP. This framework provides robust authentication, authorization, and access control across all platform components.

**Key Capabilities:**
- Multi-factor authentication and single sign-on
- Role-based and policy-based access control
- SMART on FHIR authentication flows
- Zero Trust security architecture
- Healthcare-specific compliance controls

```javascript
// Example: OAuth 2.0 token request for API access
POST /oauth2/token
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

grant_type=authorization_code&
code=AUTH_CODE&
client_id=CLIENT_ID&
redirect_uri=https://app.example.com/callback
```

**Key Capabilities:**
- Comprehensive FHIR Server APIs with RESTful endpoints
- Flexible data persistence with optimized storage options
- Role-based access control for healthcare data
- FHIR Subscription Topics and real-time notifications
- Implementation Guide installation and development
- Bulk data operations for population health management

```javascript
// Example: Retrieving a patient resource
GET /fhir/Patient/123456
Accept: application/fhir+json
```

[FHIR Interoperability Platform Documentation →](/architecture/core_components/fhir-interoperability-platform/01-getting-started/overview/)

### Federated Graph API
The unified API layer exposes capabilities across all systems through a coherent GraphQL interface, enabling product teams to efficiently access data and services while maintaining service boundaries.

```graphql
# Example: Querying patient and medication data
query {
  patient(id: "123456") {
    name { given family }
    medications {
      name
      dosage
      status
    }
  }
}
```

### Design System
Our comprehensive design system combines Radix UI primitives and Material-UI components with Tailwind CSS, Storybook, and healthcare-specific patterns to create consistent, accessible user interfaces across all applications.

**Key Capabilities:**
- Accessible, WCAG 2.1 AA compliant components
- Healthcare-specific UI patterns
- Consistent design language and tokens
- Comprehensive documentation and examples
- Automated testing and quality assurance

```jsx
// Example: Using a clinical component
import { PatientBanner } from '@healthcare/clinical';

function PatientView({ patientId }) {
  return (
    <div className="p-4">
      <PatientBanner 
        patientId={patientId}
        showAllergies={true}
        compact={false}
      />
      {/* Additional patient information */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Event Broker
Our platform uses Confluent Kafka to implement a robust event broker, enabling real-time data processing, system decoupling, and comprehensive visibility into the patient journey.

**Key Event Types:**
- Patient registration events
- Medication access events
- Insurance verification events
- Clinical data updates

### Workflow Orchestration Engine
Our Workflow Orchestration Engine combines multiple technologies to create a comprehensive solution for healthcare process automation. This engine integrates a business process manager, rules engine, Confluent Kafka, and Azure Functions to build flexible orchestration pipelines that handle complex healthcare workflows efficiently.

**Key Components:**
- Business process manager for workflow definition and monitoring
- Rules engine for complex decision logic and policy enforcement
- Confluent Kafka for event-driven process triggers and communication
- Azure Functions for serverless process execution and integration
- Process analytics and monitoring dashboards

```javascript
// Example: Defining a workflow step in Azure Functions
export default async function (context, event) {
  // Process a prior authorization event
  const patientId = event.data.patientId;
  const medicationRequest = event.data.medicationRequest;
  
  // Apply rules engine for coverage determination
  const coverageDecision = await determineCoverage(patientId, medicationRequest);
  
  // Publish result to next step in workflow
  context.bindings.outputEvent = {
    patientId,
    medicationRequest,
    coverageDecision,
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
  };
  
  return { status: 'completed' };
}
```

## Common Implementation Scenarios
<!-- Scenario Diagram: A sequence diagram showing interactions between key components for a prior authorization workflow, including data flow between systems, event publishing, and API calls. -->

### Prior Authorization Submission

A common implementation scenario involves connecting an EHR system to our prior authorization workflow. This process leverages our FHIR server, event broker, and business process management capabilities to automate and streamline the authorization process.

1. EHR system sends patient and prescription data via FHIR API
2. Platform translates incoming data to canonical FHIR format
3. Events trigger appropriate workflows based on payer and medication
4. Status updates are published via events and accessible through APIs
5. Determinations are returned to EHR with supporting documentation
