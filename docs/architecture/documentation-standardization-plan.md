# Documentation Standardization Plan

## Introduction

This document outlines the standardization plan for the CMM Reference Architecture documentation. The goal is to ensure consistency, completeness, and quality across all core components' documentation. This plan defines the structure, standards, and implementation approach to achieve a uniform documentation experience throughout the architecture.

## Documentation Structure

### Tier-Based Organization

All core components must follow a consistent 5-tier documentation structure:

1. **01-getting-started**: Introduction, quick start guides, and basic concepts
2. **02-core-functionality**: Core features, main APIs, and primary use cases
3. **03-advanced-patterns**: Advanced usage patterns, integrations, and complex scenarios
4. **04-governance-compliance**: Governance frameworks, compliance considerations, and security controls
5. **05-operations**: Deployment, monitoring, scaling, and maintenance

### Folder Structure

Each component must maintain the following folder structure:

```
/docs/architecture/core_components/[component-name]/
├── 01-getting-started/
│   ├── overview.md
│   ├── quick-start.md
│   ├── key-concepts.md
│   └── architecture.md
├── 02-core-functionality/
│   ├── core-apis.md
│   ├── data-model.md
│   ├── integration-points.md
│   └── [feature-specific-docs].md
├── 03-advanced-patterns/
│   ├── advanced-use-cases.md
│   ├── extension-points.md
│   ├── customization.md
│   └── [pattern-specific-docs].md
├── 04-governance-compliance/
│   ├── access-controls.md
│   ├── data-governance.md
│   ├── audit-compliance.md
│   ├── regulatory-compliance.md
│   └── [additional-governance-docs].md
└── 05-operations/
    ├── deployment.md
    ├── monitoring.md
    ├── scaling.md
    ├── troubleshooting.md
    └── maintenance.md
```

## Document Templates and Content Guidelines

### Standard Document Structure

Each document should follow this general structure:

1. **Title**: Clear, descriptive title
2. **Introduction**: Brief overview of the document's purpose and scope
3. **Main Content**: Organized in logical sections with clear headings
4. **Code Examples**: Where applicable, with proper syntax highlighting
5. **Diagrams**: Where helpful, using mermaid or other standard formats
6. **Conclusion**: Summary of key points
7. **Related Resources**: Links to related documentation

### Content Focus and Avoiding Redundancy

To ensure documentation is focused and minimizes redundancy:

1. **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each document should have a clear, singular focus
2. **Cross-Reference Instead of Duplicate**: Link to other documents rather than duplicating content
3. **Component-Specific Content**: Focus on component-specific implementations rather than general concepts
4. **Appropriate Detail Level**: Match the detail level to the document's purpose and audience
5. **Consistent Terminology**: Use consistent terminology across all documents

### What Should and Should Not Be Included

The following guidelines help determine what content belongs in each document:

| Document Type | Should Include | Should Not Include |
|--------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Overview | Component purpose, key features, high-level architecture, primary use cases | Detailed implementation, code examples, configuration details |
| Architecture | Component design, internal structure, data flow, integration points | Detailed code examples, step-by-step tutorials, operational procedures |
| API Documentation | API endpoints, parameters, return values, error codes, usage examples | Internal implementation details, deployment procedures, general concepts |
| Tutorials | Step-by-step instructions, specific use cases, expected outcomes | Comprehensive API references, architectural details, theoretical concepts |
| Reference Architecture | System-wide architecture, component relationships, design patterns, architectural decisions | Component-specific implementation details, code examples, operational procedures |

Reference architecture documentation should be reserved for system-wide architectural documentation and should not be duplicated in component-specific documentation. Component documentation should reference the system architecture rather than reproducing it.

## Conclusion

This documentation standardization plan provides a comprehensive approach to ensuring consistent, high-quality documentation across all components of the CMM Reference Architecture. By following this plan, we will create a unified documentation experience that enhances usability, maintainability, and compliance.

The implementation of this plan should be treated as a project with clear phases, responsibilities, and timelines. Regular reviews and updates to the documentation will ensure it remains accurate and valuable as the architecture evolves.
