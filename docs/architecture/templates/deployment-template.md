# [Component Name] Deployment

## Introduction
This document outlines the deployment architecture, strategies, and processes for the [Component Name] at CoverMyMeds. It provides infrastructure teams and platform engineers with a comprehensive guide to deploying and managing the [Component Name] infrastructure in a secure, scalable, and compliant manner.

## Deployment Architecture

### Platform Components
The [Component Name] deployment consists of the following core components:

| Component | Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| **[Primary Component]** | [Technology/Version] | [Primary functionality] |
| **[Supporting Component 1]** | [Technology/Version] | [Supporting functionality] |
| **[Supporting Component 2]** | [Technology/Version] | [Supporting functionality] |
| **[Additional Components...]** | [Technology/Version] | [Additional functionality] |

### Deployment Environments

| Environment | Purpose | Scale | Notes |
|-------------|---------|-------|-------|
| **Development** | Feature development, testing | [Scale description] | [Environment-specific notes] |
| **QA/Test** | Integration testing, performance validation | [Scale description] | [Environment-specific notes] |
| **Staging** | Pre-production validation | [Scale description] | [Environment-specific notes] |
| **Production** | Business-critical workloads | [Scale description] | [Environment-specific notes] |
| **DR** | Disaster recovery | [Scale description] | [Environment-specific notes] |

## Infrastructure Provisioning

### Kubernetes-Based Deployment
The [Component Name] is deployed on Kubernetes using [deployment method]:

```yaml
# Example Kubernetes manifest for [Component Name]
apiVersion: [api version]
kind: [resource type]
metadata:
  name: [resource name]
  namespace: [namespace]
spec:
  # Key specifications
  replicas: [replica count]
  # Additional specifications based on component requirements
```

### Infrastructure as Code
All infrastructure is provisioned using:
- **Terraform**: Cloud infrastructure ([specific resources])
- **Helm Charts**: Kubernetes resources and operators
- **GitOps**: [GitOps tool] for deployment automation
- **Custom CRDs**: Extensions for CMM-specific configurations

## Network Architecture

### Network Topology
- **Service Mesh**: [Service mesh technology] for secure service-to-service communication
- **Ingress**: [Ingress controller] with WAF integration
- **DNS**: [DNS solution] for service discovery
- **Load Balancing**: [Load balancer type] for endpoint access
- **Private Connectivity**: [Solution] for cross-account access

### Security Groups and Firewalls
- [Component] endpoints: [Access pattern]
- [Component] management interfaces: [Access pattern]
- [Component] APIs: [Access pattern]
- [Component] monitoring interfaces: [Access pattern]
