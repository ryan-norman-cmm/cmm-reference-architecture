## Versioning Strategy

[Component Name] follows semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) to clearly communicate the nature of changes in each release.

### Version Numbering

- **Major Version (X.0.0)**: Incremented for incompatible API changes or significant architectural changes that require migration efforts. Major versions may introduce breaking changes to APIs, data models, or core functionality.

- **Minor Version (0.X.0)**: Incremented for new functionality added in a backward-compatible manner. Minor versions add features without breaking existing functionality.

- **Patch Version (0.0.X)**: Incremented for backward-compatible bug fixes, security updates, or minor improvements that don't add new functionality.

### [Standard/Specification] Compatibility

In addition to semantic versioning, each release specifies compatibility with [relevant standard or specification] versions:

- **[Standard Version 1]**: [Compatibility status]
- **[Standard Version 2]**: [Compatibility status]
