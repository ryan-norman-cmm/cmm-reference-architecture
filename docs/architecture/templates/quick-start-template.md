# [Component Name] Quick Start Guide

## Introduction

This guide will help you quickly get started with the **[Component Name]** capability in the CMM Azure development environment. This approach uses the fully-managed version of the service rather than a local development setup, allowing you to experiment with the platform capabilities immediately without complex configuration.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- [ ] An active Azure AD account with access to the CMM development subscription
- [ ] Azure CLI installed and authenticated with your CMM account 
- [ ] Required role assignments (details below)
- [ ] [Any component-specific tools, e.g., Kafka CLI, Apollo Rover, etc.]

## Accessing the Managed Service

### Azure Authentication

1. Authenticate with Azure:

   ```bash
   az login
   ```

2. Set your subscription to the CMM development environment:

   ```bash
   az account set --subscription "CMM-Development"
   ```

3. Verify you have the required roles:

   ```bash
   az role assignment list --assignee [your-email@covermymeds.com]
   ```

   You should see at least these roles:
   - [Role 1]
   - [Role 2]

### Service Endpoints

The **[Component Name]** is available at the following endpoints in the development environment:

| Service | Endpoint | Purpose |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Admin Portal | `https://component-name-placeholder-admin.dev.cmm.azure.com` | Management dashboard |
| API Gateway | `https://component-name-placeholder-api.dev.cmm.azure.com` | REST/GraphQL API access |
| Metrics Dashboard | `https://component-name-placeholder-metrics.dev.cmm.azure.com` | Observability and monitoring |

## Basic Usage Examples

### Example 1: [Basic Task Name]

```typescript
// TypeScript Example for basic task
import { Client } from '@cmm/component-name-placeholder-client';

async function quickStart() {
  // Initialize client with Azure authentication
  const client = new Client({
    endpoint: 'https://component-name-placeholder-api.dev.cmm.azure.com',
    authProvider: new AzureIdentityAuthProvider()
  });
  
  // Perform basic operation
  const result = await client.performOperation({
    // Parameters here
  });
  
  console.log('Operation completed:', result);
}
```

### Example 2: [Another Basic Task]

```typescript
// Code example for another common task
```

## Resource Limitations

The development environment has the following limitations:

| Resource | Limit | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| [Resource Type] | [Limit] | [Any special considerations] |
| [Resource Type] | [Limit] | [Any special considerations] |

## Environment Cleanup

**Important:** The development environment is shared. After completing your testing:

1. Delete any test resources you created
2. Clean up any temporary data sets
3. Log out when finished:
   ```bash
   az logout
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Authentication failure | Ensure your Azure AD account has appropriate access and MFA is completed |
| Rate limiting | The development environment has stricter rate limits than production |
| Missing resources | Your account may need additional role assignments |

### Getting Support

If you encounter issues accessing the development environment:

1. Check the status dashboard at `https://cmm-status.dev.cmm.azure.com`
2. Contact the platform team in the Microsoft Teams channel: `#platformteam-support`
3. Submit a request with the IT service desk for access issues

## Next Steps

After completing this quick start guide:

- Explore the full [API documentation](../03-core-functionality/core-apis.md)
- Learn about [advanced capabilities](../04-advanced-patterns/advanced-use-cases.md)
- Understand [security considerations](../05-governance-compliance/access-controls.md)
- Set up a [local development environment](local-setup.md) for deeper customization
