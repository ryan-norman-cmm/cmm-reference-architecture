### [Module/Service 3]

[Description of the module/service's purpose, responsibilities, and key interfaces]

## Data Flow

[Description of how data flows through the component, including sequence diagrams for key operations]

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant API
    participant Service
    participant DataStore
    
    Client->>API: Request
    API->>Service: Process
    Service->>DataStore: Query/Update
    DataStore-->>Service: Result
    Service-->>API: Response
    API-->>Client: Result
```
