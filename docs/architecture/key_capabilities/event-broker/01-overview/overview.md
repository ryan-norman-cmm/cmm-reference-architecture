# Event-Driven Architecture Overview

## Introduction
The Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) capability is a comprehensive platform framework that enables real-time, event-driven communication and processing across the healthcare ecosystem. This capability extends beyond the core Event Broker (Confluent Kafka) to encompass event sourcing, stream processing, event orchestration, and event-driven microservices patterns. It provides a complete foundation for building reactive, resilient, and responsive healthcare systems that deliver immediate value through real-time data flows.

## Key Features
- **Event Broker Infrastructure**: Enterprise-grade Confluent Kafka deployment with comprehensive tooling
- **Event Streaming Patterns Library**: Reusable templates for common healthcare event flows
- **Event Schema Registry**: Centralized governance for event format standardization and evolution
- **Stream Processing Framework**: Real-time data transformation and enrichment capabilities
- **Event Sourcing Support**: Patterns and infrastructure for event-sourced application design
- **Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)**: Implementation patterns for complex domain modeling
- **Event Choreography & Orchestration**: Tools for coordinating multi-step workflows across services
- **Event-Driven Monitoring**: Real-time visibility into event flows and system health

## Technology Stack
- **Event Broker**: Confluent Kafka Platform (including Connect, Schema Registry, ksqlDB)
- **Stream Processing**: Kafka Streams, Apache Flink
- **Event Sourcing**: Axon Framework, EventStoreDB
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Temporal, Apache Airflow
- **Observability**: OpenTelemetry, Elasticsearch, Kibana, Prometheus, Grafana

## Architecture Overview
- The Event-Driven Architecture serves as the communication backbone and processing framework for the entire platform, enabling loosely coupled, highly reactive systems.
- It implements multiple interaction patterns including publish-subscribe, event sourcing, CQRS, and event streaming.
- The architecture provides a layered approach from core infrastructure (Kafka) to application patterns (event sourcing, CQRS) that teams can adopt according to their needs.
- The capability includes both the central event broker infrastructure and the distributed patterns for utilizing events throughout applications.

## Integration Points
- **FHIR Interoperability Platform**: Standardized healthcare events following FHIR resource models
- **Federated Graph API**: Real-time data subscriptions and event-triggered updates
- **API Marketplace**: Event-driven API patterns and webhooks
- **Design System**: UI patterns for real-time updates and notifications
- **Cross-Platform Services**: Event-based integration with all platform services

## Use Cases
- **Real-time Clinical Workflows**: Immediate care coordination across providers and systems
- **Reactive Healthcare Applications**: User interfaces that update in real-time as conditions change
- **Patient Journey Orchestration**: End-to-end tracking and coordination of patient interactions
- **Distributed System Integration**: Loosely coupled communication between microservices
- **Event-Sourced Healthcare Records**: Complete, auditable history of healthcare data changes
- **Complex Event Processing**: Detecting patterns in healthcare events for decision support
- **Healthcare Analytics**: Real-time streaming analytics for operational and clinical insights
- **Regulatory Compliance Monitoring**: Comprehensive audit trails through event capture

## Business Value
- Transforms healthcare processes from batch to real-time, dramatically improving patient experiences
- Reduces system interdependencies by 80%, enabling greater team autonomy and innovation
- Enables 10x faster data propagation across the enterprise
- Provides foundation for resilient, scalable architectures that can evolve independently
- Creates comprehensive visibility into healthcare processes through event streams
