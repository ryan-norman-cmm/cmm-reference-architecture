# Event-Driven Architecture Key Concepts

## Introduction
This document outlines the fundamental concepts and terminology of the Event-Driven Architecture capability, providing a comprehensive overview of the patterns, principles, and components that enable event-driven systems across the healthcare ecosystem.

## Core Event-Driven Architecture Concepts

### Events
Events are immutable records of something that has happened in the system or domain.

- **Events** represent facts that have occurred, not commands or requests
- Events are immutable and cannot be deleted or modified once created
- Events contain all relevant data about what happened
- Events typically include metadata (timestamp, source, correlation IDs)
- Examples: `PatientAdmitted`, `MedicationPrescribed`, `PriorAuthApproved`

### Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)
Event-Driven Architecture is a software design paradigm where the production, detection, consumption of, and reaction to events drive the system's behavior.

- **Event Producers** generate events when something notable happens
- **Event Consumers** react to events they're interested in 
- **Event Broker** facilitates reliable delivery of events between producers and consumers
- **Event Processing** transforms, enriches, and analyzes event streams
- EDA promotes loose coupling, scalability, and resilience

### Event Broker
The Event Broker is the central nervous system of an event-driven architecture, providing reliable event transport and storage.

- The foundation is Confluent Kafka, an enterprise-grade distributed event streaming platform
- Provides durability, high throughput, and exactly-once delivery guarantees
- Enables temporal decoupling between event producers and consumers
- Maintains an immutable, ordered log of events
- Offers fault tolerance through replication and distribution

## Event Streaming Concepts

### Topics
Topics are the fundamental organizational unit for events, providing logical groupings of related events.

- **Topics** are named channels or feeds of events
- Events in a topic can be read as many times as needed by different consumer groups
- Topics are partitioned for scalability and parallel processing
- Examples: `patient-admissions`, `medication-orders`, `prior-authorization-status`
- Topics should be organized by business domain and event type

### Partitions
Each topic is divided into partitions, which are the unit of parallelism and ordering.

- **Partitions** allow horizontal scaling and parallel processing
- Events with the same key go to the same partition (important for ordering)
- Each partition is an ordered, immutable sequence of events
- Partitions are distributed across the Kafka cluster for fault tolerance
- The number of partitions determines maximum parallelism

### Producers
Producers are applications that publish events to topics.

- **Producers** determine which topic and partition an event is written to
- Can send events synchronously or asynchronously
- Specify a key with each event to ensure related events go to the same partition
- Support various serialization formats (JSON, Avro, Protobuf)
- Can implement idempotency to prevent duplicate events

### Consumers and Consumer Groups
Consumers read events from topics and process them.

- **Consumers** subscribe to one or more topics
- **Consumer Groups** allow for scalable, fault-tolerant consumption
- Each partition is consumed by only one consumer in a group
- Adding consumers to a group (up to the number of partitions) increases throughput
- Automatic rebalancing when consumers join or leave

### Offsets
Offsets are how the event broker tracks which events have been consumed.

- **Offsets** are sequential IDs given to events in a partition
- Consumers commit offsets to track their progress
- Allow consumers to resume from where they left off after a restart
- Enable replay of events from any point in time (within the retention period)
- Support different consumption patterns (latest, earliest, specific offset)

## Schema Management

### Schema Registry
The Schema Registry maintains and evolves event schemas, ensuring compatibility.

- **Schemas** define the structure of events (fields, types, etc.)
- Enforces schema compatibility during evolution (backward, forward, or full)
- Supports Avro, JSON Schema, and Protobuf formats
- Prevents breaking changes that could disrupt consumers
- Enables automatic client-side serialization and deserialization

### Schema Evolution
Schema evolution is the process of changing event schemas over time.

- **Compatibility Types**:
  - **Backward**: New schema can read data written with old schema
  - **Forward**: Old schema can read data written with new schema
  - **Full**: Both backward and forward compatible
- **Evolution Strategies**:
  - Adding optional fields
  - Using default values for new fields
  - Never removing or renaming fields
  - Never changing field types

### Event Standardization
Event standardization ensures consistency across all events in the system.

- **Event Envelope**: Standard metadata structure for all events
- **Naming Conventions**: Consistent naming for topics and event types
- **Healthcare-Specific Standards**: FHIR-aligned event structures
- **Domain-Driven Event Design**: Events reflect domain language and concepts
- **Event Versioning**: Clear versioning strategy for events

## Advanced Event Patterns
