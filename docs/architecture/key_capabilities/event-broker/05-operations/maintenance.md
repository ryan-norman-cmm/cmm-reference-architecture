## Maintenance Procedures

### Broker Patching and Upgrades

#### Pre-Upgrade Checklist
- [ ] Review release notes for breaking changes
- [ ] Test upgrade in lower environments
- [ ] Verify client compatibility with new version
- [ ] Create full backup and snapshot
- [ ] Schedule maintenance window with stakeholders
- [ ] Prepare rollback plan
- [ ] Verify monitoring system functionality

#### Rolling Upgrade Process
Rolling upgrades ensure zero downtime by upgrading one broker at a time:

1. **Preparation**
   - Deploy upgrade artifacts to all broker nodes
   - Verify sufficient capacity to handle broker removal
   - Validate health of all brokers before starting

2. **Execution**
   - For each broker (one at a time):
     - Remove from load balancer or mark as draining
     - Ensure no under-replicated partitions
     - Verify it's not the controller (if applicable)
     - Stop broker service
     - Apply upgrade
     - Start broker service
     - Verify broker rejoins cluster successfully
     - Wait for partition rebalancing to complete
     - Verify no performance impact before proceeding

3. **Validation**
   - Verify all brokers running new version
   - Confirm no under-replicated partitions
   - Run health check suite
   - Validate performance metrics
   - Check for any unexpected log errors

#### Upgrade Rollback Procedure
If issues occur during upgrade:

1. Stop the upgrade process immediately
2. Assess the scope of impact
3. For affected brokers:
   - Stop broker service
   - Revert to previous version
   - Start broker service
4. Verify cluster health after rollback
5. Document issues for future prevention

### Schema Registry Maintenance

#### Schema Cleanup Process
Periodic cleanup of unused schemas:

1. **Identification**
   - Query for unused schemas (no access in 90+ days)
   - Generate report of deprecation candidates
   - Send notification to schema owners

2. **Deprecation**
   - Mark schemas as deprecated in registry
   - Add deprecation notice to schema documentation
   - Set 30-day grace period before deletion

3. **Removal**
   - After grace period, verify no usage
   - Archive schema definition in long-term storage
   - Delete from active registry

### Topic Management

#### Topic Cleanup Workflow
Regular cleanup of unused or deprecated topics:

1. **Identification**
   - Find topics with no recent activity
   - Check topics exceeding retention policies
   - Identify temporary topics eligible for deletion

2. **Verification**
   - Confirm topic is safe to remove with owners
   - Verify no active consumers or producers
   - Document topic metadata for records

3. **Deletion**
   - Take final backup if required
   - Delete topic with appropriate kafka-topics command
   - Update topic registry documentation
   - Verify cleanup of storage

#### Partition Rebalancing
Periodic rebalancing to optimize cluster performance:

1. **Assessment**
   - Generate partition distribution report
   - Identify brokers with disproportionate loads
   - Calculate optimal partition distribution

2. **Planning**
   - Create reassignment JSON file
   - Estimate impact and duration
   - Schedule during low-traffic period

3. **Execution**
   - Execute reassignment in batches
   - Monitor reassignment progress
   - Track performance metrics during rebalancing

```bash
# Example partition reassignment
# 1. Generate the reassignment plan
kafka-reassign-partitions --bootstrap-server kafka:9092 \
  --topics-to-move-json-file topics-to-move.json \
  --broker-list "101,102,103,104" \
  --generate

# 2. Save the output to reassignment.json and execute
kafka-reassign-partitions --bootstrap-server kafka:9092 \
  --reassignment-json-file reassignment.json \
  --execute

# 3. Verify the reassignment status
kafka-reassign-partitions --bootstrap-server kafka:9092 \
  --reassignment-json-file reassignment.json \
  --verify
```

### Storage Management

#### Log Segment Cleanup
Management of log segments and storage:

1. **Monitoring**
   - Track disk usage across broker nodes
   - Monitor log segment growth rates
   - Alert on approaching thresholds

2. **Automated Cleanup**
   - Verify retention policies are properly set
   - Confirm log cleaners are functioning
   - Adjust cleanup.policy settings if needed

3. **Manual Intervention**
   - For topics requiring special handling
   - During unexpected storage growth
   - Emergency cleanup if approaching limits

```yaml
# Example retention configuration
topic:
  retention:
    # Time-based retention (7 days)
    retentionMs: 604800000
    # Size-based retention (10 GB)
    retentionBytes: 10737418240
    # Cleanup policy (delete or compact)
    cleanupPolicy: delete
```

#### Storage Expansion Procedure
Process for expanding broker storage:

1. **Capacity Planning**
   - Forecast storage needs based on growth
   - Determine timing for expansion
   - Request additional storage allocation

2. **Implementation**
   - For cloud-based storage:
     - Use infrastructure as code to expand volumes
     - Apply changes in rolling fashion
   - For on-premise:
     - Add storage hardware
     - Extend logical volumes

3. **Verification**
   - Confirm storage recognition by OS
   - Verify Kafka broker recognizes additional space
   - Update monitoring thresholds

## Security Maintenance

   - Add missing required permissions
   - Update documentation with changes

3. **Verification**
   - Validate critical service access
   - Confirm proper authorization
   - Update security posture report

```bash
# List all ACLs
kafka-acls --bootstrap-server kafka:9092 --list

# Remove unnecessary ACLs
kafka-acls --bootstrap-server kafka:9092 --remove \
  --allow-principal User:old-service \
  --operation Read --topic customer-data

# Add new ACLs
