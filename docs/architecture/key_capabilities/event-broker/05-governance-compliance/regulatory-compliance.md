# Event Broker Regulatory Compliance

## Introduction
The Event Broker platform is designed to facilitate the exchange of healthcare information in compliance with applicable regulations. This document outlines the regulatory frameworks that govern our event-driven architecture and the controls implemented to ensure compliance.

## Regulatory Framework

### Healthcare Regulations

#### HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)
- **Privacy Rule**: Controls on Protected Health Information (PHI) in event payloads
- **Security Rule**: Technical safeguards for securing event data
- **Breach Notification Rule**: Processes for identifying and reporting data breaches
- **Enforcement**: Compliance validation and documentation

#### HITRUST CSF (Health Information Trust Alliance Common Security Framework)
- Comprehensive security controls mapped to NIST, ISO, PCI, and HIPAA
- Risk-based approach to security implementation
- Certification requirements for healthcare data processing

#### 21 CFR Part 11 (FDA)
- Electronic signature requirements for clinical data
- Audit trail protections for regulated healthcare events
- System validation documentation requirements

### General Data Protection

#### GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
- Data subject rights handling in event streams
- Right to erasure ("right to be forgotten") implementation
- Purpose limitation and data minimization principles
- Cross-border data transfer restrictions

#### CCPA/CPRA (California Consumer Privacy Act/California Privacy Rights Act)
- Consumer rights over personal information
- Opt-out mechanisms for data sharing
- Disclosure requirements for data handling practices

## Compliance Controls

### Data Protection

| Requirement | Implementation |
|-------------|---------------|
| **PHI/PII Encryption** | End-to-end encryption for all PHI/PII data in event payloads |
| **Data Minimization** | Schema governance enforcing minimum necessary data collection |
| **Retention Limits** | Time-based retention policies aligned with regulatory requirements |
| **Data Subject Rights** | Event sourcing patterns enabling data subject access and deletion requests |

### Technical Safeguards

| Safeguard | Implementation |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Authentication** | Multi-factor authentication for all administrative access |
| **Authorization** | Fine-grained RBAC controlling topic and consumer group access |
| **Transmission Security** | TLS 1.3 for all data in transit |
| **Integrity Controls** | Digital signatures and checksums for event validation |

### Administrative Controls

| Control | Implementation |
|---------|---------------|
| **Policies & Procedures** | Documented data handling policies for event producers/consumers |
| **Training** | Required security and compliance training for all personnel |
| **Risk Assessment** | Annual risk analysis of the Event Broker infrastructure |
| **Business Associate Agreements** | Contracts with vendors handling PHI through our event streams |

## Compliance by Design

### Architecture Patterns

#### Topic Segmentation
- PHI-containing topics segregated from non-PHI data
- Fine-grained access controls at the topic level
- Clear data classification labels on topics

#### Compliant Event Processing
- Automated PHI detection in event streams
- De-identification capabilities for analytics use cases
- Consent tracking through event metadata

#### Audit-Ready Infrastructure
- Complete audit trails of all system activities
- Evidence collection for compliance documentation
- Automated compliance monitoring and reporting

### Validation and Testing

| Testing Type | Frequency | Purpose |
|--------------|-----------|---------|
| **Penetration Testing** | Semi-annual | Identify security vulnerabilities |
| **Compliance Scans** | Monthly | Validate control effectiveness |
| **Configuration Audits** | Quarterly | Ensure alignment with baseline |
| **Access Reviews** | Quarterly | Validate appropriate access permissions |

## Compliance Documentation

### Required Documentation
- System Security Plan (SSP)
- Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA)
- Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) for high-risk processing
- Incident Response Plan specific to event data breaches
- Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Plans

### Evidence Collection
- Automated evidence collection for audit purposes
- Compliance dashboard showing control effectiveness
- Regular attestation reports from component owners
