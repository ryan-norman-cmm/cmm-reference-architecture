# Design System Key Concepts

## Introduction
This document outlines the fundamental concepts and terminology of the Design System core component, which is built on React, Tailwind CSS, and ShadCN UI. It serves as a reference for developers, designers, and product managers working with the Design System.

## Core Terminology

- **Design Token**: A named variable that stores visual design attributes (colors, spacing, typography, etc.) to ensure consistency across applications.

- **Component**: A reusable, self-contained UI element that fulfills a specific function or displays specific content (e.g., Button, Card, Form elements).

- **Pattern**: A reusable solution to a common design problem, composed of multiple components and interactions (e.g., search patterns, form validation patterns).

- **Composition**: The practice of building complex UI elements by combining smaller, simpler components.

- **Accessibility (a11y)**: The practice of designing and developing digital products that can be used by everyone, including people with disabilities.

- **Design Language**: A set of rules, constraints, and principles that ensure visual and functional consistency across products.

- **Theme**: A collection of design tokens and styles that define the visual appearance of components and can be swapped to change the look and feel.

- **Storybook**: A development environment tool for UI components that enables component documentation, testing, and visual review.

## Fundamental Concepts

### Atomic Design Methodology

The Design System follows the Atomic Design methodology, organizing components into a hierarchy:

1. **Atoms**: Basic building blocks (buttons, inputs, labels)
2. **Molecules**: Simple component groups that function together (search bar, form field)
3. **Organisms**: Complex component combinations (navigation header, user dashboard)
4. **Templates**: Page-level component arrangements
5. **Pages**: Specific instances of templates with real content

This approach enables consistent design at every scale while promoting reusability and composability.

### Design Tokens

Design tokens are the foundation of the Design System, providing:

- **Consistent Visual Language**: Standardized colors, typography, spacing, etc.
- **Theme Support**: Ability to switch between themes (light/dark, brand variations)
- **Accessibility Compliance**: Ensuring proper color contrast and readability
- **Platform Adaptability**: Same tokens can be used across web, mobile, and other platforms

Tokens are categorized into:
- **Global Tokens**: Foundational values (brand colors, typography scale)
- **Alias Tokens**: Contextual references to global tokens (primary-button-background)
- **Component Tokens**: Specific to individual components (button-padding-small)

### Component Architecture

Components in the Design System follow these principles:

- **Encapsulation**: Components hide their internal complexity
- **Composition**: Complex components are built from simpler ones
- **Prop-based Configuration**: Behavior and appearance controlled via props
- **Accessibility First**: Built with accessibility in mind from the start
- **Responsive Design**: Adaptable to different screen sizes and devices
- **Performance Optimized**: Efficient rendering and minimal bundle size

### Accessibility Standards

The Design System adheres to WCAG 2.1 AA standards, including:

- **Keyboard Navigation**: All interactive elements are accessible via keyboard
- **Screen Reader Support**: Proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML
- **Color Contrast**: Meeting minimum contrast ratios for text and UI elements
- **Focus Management**: Clear visual indicators for focused elements
- **Responsive Text**: Text that scales appropriately for readability
- **Reduced Motion**: Support for users who prefer minimal animation

### Healthcare-Specific Patterns

The Design System includes patterns designed specifically for healthcare applications:

- **Clinical Data Display**: Specialized components for presenting patient data
- **Medication Management**: Interfaces for prescribing and reviewing medications
- **Care Planning**: Templates for care plan creation and management
- **Healthcare Forms**: Standardized forms for healthcare workflows
- **Patient Timeline**: Visualizations of patient history and events
