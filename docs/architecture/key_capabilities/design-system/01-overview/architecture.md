# Design System Architecture

## Introduction
This document outlines the architectural design of the Design System core component, providing insights into its structure, principles, and integration patterns. The Design System is built on React, Tailwind CSS, and ShadCN UI to provide reusable, accessible UI components for healthcare applications.

## Architectural Overview
The Design System follows a modular, composable architecture that prioritizes accessibility, performance, and developer experience. It implements a token-based design language that ensures visual consistency while supporting theming and customization.

The architecture separates concerns between design tokens, core components, and complex patterns, enabling teams to adopt incrementally and evolve the system over time.

## Component Structure

### Foundation Layer
- **Design Tokens**: Core visual variables (colors, typography, spacing, etc.)
- **Theme System**: Light/dark mode and brand variants
- **Grid System**: Responsive layout foundations
- **Typography**: Text styles and hierarchies
- **Iconography**: Standard icon set and usage guidelines

### Core Component Layer
- **Primitive Components**: Basic UI elements (buttons, inputs, etc.)
- **Composite Components**: Combinations of primitives (forms, cards, etc.)
- **Layout Components**: Structural elements for page composition
- **Navigation Components**: Menus, tabs, breadcrumbs, etc.
- **Feedback Components**: Alerts, notifications, progress indicators

### Pattern Layer
- **Healthcare Patterns**: Domain-specific UI solutions
- **Page Templates**: Common page layouts and structures
- **Interaction Patterns**: Standard behavior models for common tasks
- **Form Patterns**: Validated approaches to form design
- **Data Visualization**: Charts, graphs, and data presentation components

### Infrastructure Layer
- **Storybook**: Component documentation and showcase
- **Testing Library**: Accessibility and functionality tests
- **Build System**: Package compilation and distribution
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated testing and deployment
- **NPM Registry**: Private package hosting (Artifactory)

## Data Flow

1. **Component Configuration Flow**:
   - Props passed to components
   - Context providers for theme and global states
   - Component internal state management
   - Event handling and callbacks

2. **Theming Flow**:
   - Theme selection at application level
   - Theme context provider distributes theme
   - Components reference theme tokens
   - CSS variables apply themed values

3. **Responsive Adaptation Flow**:
   - Viewport size detection
   - Breakpoint-based adjustments
   - Component-level responsive behavior
   - Layout system accommodations

4. **Accessibility Flow**:
   - ARIA attributes and roles
   - Keyboard navigation paths
   - Focus management
   - Screen reader announcements

## Design Patterns

- **Compound Components**: Related components that work together (e.g., Select with Option children)
- **Render Props**: Components that accept render functions for flexibility
- **Component Composition**: Building complex UIs from simpler components
- **Controlled vs. Uncontrolled Components**: Supporting both paradigms for form elements
- **Prop Collection/Getter Pattern**: Providing sets of props to apply to elements
- **State Reducer Pattern**: Allowing customization of component internal state changes
- **Hook-based Utilities**: Providing reusable behavior through custom hooks

## Technology Stack

| Component | Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| Core Framework | React | Component model and rendering |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS | Utility-first styling approach |
| Component Foundation | ShadCN UI | Accessible, unstyled component primitives |
| Documentation | Storybook | Component showcase and documentation |
| Testing | React Testing Library, Jest | Component testing |
| Build Tools | TypeScript, Vite | Type safety and bundling |
| Deployment | GitHub Actions | Automated deployment pipeline |
| Package Hosting | Artifactory | Private NPM registry |

## Integration Architecture

### Integration with Core Components

- **API Marketplace**: 
  - Provides UI components for the developer portal
  - Implements API console and documentation viewers

- **FHIR Interoperability Platform**:
  - Specialized components for FHIR resource visualization
  - Form patterns for FHIR data capture

- **Federated Graph API**:
  - Data fetching patterns for GraphQL
  - Loading and error state handling

- **Event Broker**:
  - Event visualization components
  - Real-time update patterns

### Application Integration

- **Component Library Import**:
  - NPM package installation from private registry
  - Import and use components with appropriate props

- **Theming Integration**:
  - Application-level theme provider setup
  - Custom theme extension when needed

- **Style Integration**:
  - Tailwind CSS configuration extension
  - CSS variable inheritance

- **Accessibility Integration**:
  - ARIA live region management
  - Focus trap implementation for modals and overlays
  - Skip link integration
