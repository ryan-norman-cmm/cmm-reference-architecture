# FHIR Interoperability Platform Data Governance

## Introduction
This document outlines the data governance framework for the FHIR Interoperability Platform. Data governance encompasses the policies, processes, standards, and controls that ensure data quality, integrity, security, and compliance throughout the data lifecycle. The FHIR Interoperability Platform's data governance framework is designed to meet the stringent requirements of healthcare data management, including regulatory compliance, semantic interoperability, and clinical utility.

## Governance Principles

The FHIR Interoperability Platform adheres to the following data governance principles:

### Data Quality

1. **Completeness**: Healthcare data must be as complete as necessary for its intended purpose.
2. **Accuracy**: Data must accurately represent the clinical concepts and patient information it describes.
3. **Consistency**: Data must be consistent across systems, formats, and over time.
4. **Timeliness**: Data must be available when needed for clinical and operational decision-making.
5. **Validity**: Data must adhere to defined formats, ranges, and rules.
6. **Uniqueness**: Duplicate data should be eliminated or appropriately managed.
7. **Precision**: Data should have the appropriate level of detail for its intended use.

### Data Stewardship

1. **Accountability**: Clear ownership and responsibility for data assets.
2. **Transparency**: Processes and decisions should be visible and documented.
3. **Auditability**: All data access and changes should be traceable and auditable.
4. **Ethical Use**: Data should be used in a manner that respects patients' rights and privacy.
5. **Informed Consent**: Data collection and use should be based on appropriate consent.
6. **Purpose Limitation**: Data should be used only for stated legitimate purposes.
7. **Minimization**: Only necessary data should be collected and retained.

### Compliance

1. **Regulatory Alignment**: All data handling must comply with applicable regulations (HIPAA, GDPR, etc.).
2. **Standards Conformance**: Data must conform to industry standards (HL7 FHIR, SNOMED CT, LOINC, etc.).
3. **Policy Enforcement**: Organizational policies must be consistently enforced.
4. **Documentation**: Compliance activities and controls must be documented.
5. **Risk Management**: Data-related risks must be identified, assessed, and mitigated.
6. **Assessment**: Regular compliance assessments must be conducted.
7. **Remediation**: Non-compliance issues must be promptly addressed.
