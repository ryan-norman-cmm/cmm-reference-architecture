# FHIR Interoperability Platform Architecture

## Introduction
This document outlines the architectural design of the FHIR Interoperability Platform core component, providing insights into its structure, data flows, and integration patterns. The FHIR Interoperability Platform is built on Health Samurai's Aidbox to provide comprehensive healthcare data exchange capabilities.

## Architectural Overview
The FHIR Interoperability Platform serves as the foundation for healthcare data interoperability across the CoverMyMeds Technology Platform. It implements a standards-based approach using the HL7 FHIR specification to ensure consistent, compliant, and efficient exchange of healthcare information.

The architecture follows a resource-oriented design with multiple API access patterns, robust security controls, and flexible storage options. It provides a unified approach to healthcare data while supporting diverse implementation guides and profiles for specific use cases.

## Component Structure

### API Layer
- **REST API**: Standard FHIR RESTful interface for CRUD operations
- **GraphQL API**: Flexible query interface for complex data retrievals
- **Bulk Data API**: High-volume data access for population health
- **SMART App Launch**: OAuth 2.0-based authorization for healthcare apps
- **Operations Framework**: Support for complex, named operations beyond basic CRUD

### Clinical Data Layer
- **Resource Processing**: Validation, storage, and retrieval of FHIR resources
- **Terminology Services**: CodeSystem and ValueSet management
- **Structural Mapping**: Transforming between data formats
- **Validation Engine**: Enforcing conformance to profiles and constraints
- **Search Engine**: Advanced query capabilities across resources

### Integration Layer
- **FHIR Version Support**: R4 with backward compatibility options
- **Implementation Guide Support**: US Core, Da Vinci, and other IGs
- **External System Connectors**: Integration with EHRs, payers, and partners
- **Internal Service Interfaces**: Event publishing and subscription
- **Data Migration**: Tools for moving data between systems

### Security & Governance Layer
- **Authentication**: Multiple authentication methods (JWT, OAuth, SMART)
- **Authorization**: Fine-grained access control at resource level
- **Consent Management**: Patient consent tracking and enforcement
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive security event recording
- **Data Provenance**: Tracking data origin and lineage

## Data Flow

1. **Resource Creation Flow**:
   - Client submits resource via REST/GraphQL API
   - Authentication and authorization checks
   - Resource validation against profiles
   - Storage in the persistence layer
   - Event generation for subscriptions
   - Response returned to client

2. **Query Flow**:
   - Client issues search request
   - Security checks applied
   - Search parameters processed
   - Query optimization and execution
   - Result pagination and bundling
   - Response returned to client

3. **Subscription Flow**:
   - Client creates a Subscription resource
   - Platform monitors for matching events
   - When matching event occurs, notification is generated
   - Notification is delivered via specified channel
   - Delivery confirmation recorded

4. **Bulk Data Flow**:
   - Client initiates bulk data export
   - System generates data extraction job
   - Data is processed and packaged asynchronously
   - Client is notified when export is complete
   - Client retrieves exported data packages

## Design Patterns

- **Resource-Oriented Architecture**: Data organized as discrete, addressable resources
- **RESTful Interfaces**: Standard HTTP methods for resource manipulation
- **Content Negotiation**: Supporting multiple formats (JSON, XML, etc.)
- **Hypermedia Links**: Resources linked for navigation and reference
- **Eventual Consistency**: Asynchronous processing with guaranteed delivery
- **Event Sourcing**: Using events as the source of truth for data changes
- **CQRS**: Separating read and write operations for specialized optimization
