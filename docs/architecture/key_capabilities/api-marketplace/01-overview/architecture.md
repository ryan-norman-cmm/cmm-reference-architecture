# API Marketplace Architecture

## Introduction
This document outlines the architectural design of the API Marketplace core component, providing insights into its structure, data flows, and integration patterns. The API Marketplace is built on MuleSoft Anypoint Platform to provide comprehensive API management capabilities for healthcare workflows.

## Architectural Overview
The API Marketplace serves as the central hub for API discovery, security, and management across the CoverMyMeds Technology Platform. It implements a multi-layered gateway architecture that handles both external (north-south) and internal (east-west) API traffic.

The architecture follows a zero-trust model with perimeter security, fine-grained access controls, and comprehensive monitoring. It provides a consistent approach to API management while supporting diverse integration patterns required by healthcare systems.

## Component Structure

### API Gateway Layer
- **Ingress Controller**: Routes incoming API requests to the appropriate services
- **Policy Enforcement Point**: Applies security, rate limiting, and other operational policies
- **Traffic Management**: Handles load balancing, circuit breaking, and routing
- **Analytics Collector**: Captures API metrics and usage patterns for analysis

### API Management Layer
- **API Manager**: Provides lifecycle management for all APIs
- **Exchange**: Central repository for API assets and documentation
- **Developer Portal**: Self-service interface for API discovery and onboarding
- **Access Manager**: Controls API access permissions and manages API clients

### Service Mesh Layer
- **Service Discovery**: Enables dynamic service location and routing
- **Proxy Sidecar**: Handles service-to-service communication security
- **Observability**: Collects telemetry data for all service interactions
- **Configuration**: Manages service mesh policies and configurations

### Control Plane
- **Governance Layer**: Enforces API standards and compliance
- **Monitoring & Alerting**: Tracks API health and performance
- **Administration UI**: Provides management interface for platform administrators
- **CI/CD Integration**: Connects with development pipelines for API deployment

## Data Flow

1. **External API Requests**:
   - Ingress through load balancers to API Gateway
   - Authentication and policy enforcement
   - Routing to appropriate backend service
   - Response processing and logging

2. **Internal Service Communication**:
   - Service-to-service discovery via service mesh
   - Mutual TLS authentication between services
   - Traffic management and circuit breaking
   - Distributed tracing across service boundaries

3. **API Lifecycle Flow**:
   - API design and specification in Exchange
   - Implementation and testing in development environments
   - Deployment through CI/CD to gateway environments
   - Monitoring and analytics in production

4. **Developer Onboarding Flow**:
   - Discovery of APIs through Developer Portal
   - Registration and credential provisioning
   - Access requests and approval workflows
   - Subscription to SLAs and usage plans

## Design Patterns

- **API Gateway Pattern**: Centralizes cross-cutting concerns like security, monitoring, and traffic management
- **Backend for Frontend (BFF)**: Creates purpose-specific API facades for different client types
- **Circuit Breaker**: Prevents cascade failures when dependent services degrade
- **Bulkhead Pattern**: Isolates failures to prevent system-wide impact
- **API Versioning**: Manages API evolution while maintaining backward compatibility
- **CQRS**: Separates read and write operations for more efficient scaling
