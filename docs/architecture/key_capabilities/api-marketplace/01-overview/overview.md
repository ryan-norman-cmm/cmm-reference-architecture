# API Marketplace Overview

## Introduction
The API Marketplace provides a unified gateway and management layer for all APIs in the platform. It combines ingress, security, and API lifecycle management, enabling secure, scalable, and discoverable API integrations for healthcare workflows. The marketplace serves as a central hub for publishing, discovering, and consuming APIs across the platform.

## Key Features
- Universal API gateway with multi-cloud support
- Zero Trust API security and governance
- Service mesh for internal service communication
- Healthcare-specific API patterns and transformations
- Comprehensive API lifecycle management
- Developer portal for API discovery and documentation

## Architecture Overview
- The API Marketplace acts as the entry point for all API traffic, providing a consistent layer for security, monitoring, and management.
- It implements API gateway patterns with traffic management, security enforcement, and observability.
- The architecture includes both north-south (external) and east-west (internal) API traffic management.

## Integration Points
- Integrates with the FHIR Interoperability Platform for healthcare API standards
- Connects with the Event-Driven Architecture for event-driven API workflows
- Provides API access to the Federated Graph API
- Enables secure external partner and third-party integrations

## Use Cases
- Centralizing API management across the platform
- Securing APIs with consistent authentication and authorization
- Enabling partner and third-party integrations
- Monitoring and analyzing API usage and performance
- Accelerating API development with reusable patterns
