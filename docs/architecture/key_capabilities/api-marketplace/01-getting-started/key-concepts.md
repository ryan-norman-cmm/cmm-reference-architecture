# API Marketplace Key Concepts

## Introduction
This document outlines the fundamental concepts and terminology of the API Marketplace core component, which is built on MuleSoft Anypoint Platform. It serves as a reference for developers, architects, and stakeholders working with the API Marketplace.

## Core Terminology

- **API Gateway**: A server that acts as an API front-end, receiving API requests, enforcing throttling and security policies, passing requests to the back-end service, and then passing the response back to the requester.

- **API Proxy**: A facade or intermediary that shields the complexity of a backend service, providing a consistent interface while enabling policy enforcement and monitoring.

- **API Specification**: A formal definition of an API that describes its endpoints, operations, request/response formats, and authentication requirements (e.g., OpenAPI, RAML, WSDL).

- **API Portal**: A developer-oriented website that provides documentation, interactive testing capabilities, and other resources for API consumption.

- **API Product**: A packaged offering that groups multiple APIs, making them available to specific developers or organizations with defined usage plans and policies.

- **Service Mesh**: An infrastructure layer for facilitating service-to-service communications between microservices, often with load balancing, service discovery, traffic monitoring, and security capabilities.

## Fundamental Concepts

### API Lifecycle Management

The API Marketplace manages the complete lifecycle of APIs:

1. **Design**: Creating API specifications and contracts using RAML or OpenAPI standards
2. **Develop**: Building the API implementation and connectors
3. **Deploy**: Publishing APIs to different environments (development, staging, production)
4. **Manage**: Applying policies, monitoring usage, and controlling access
5. **Retire**: Deprecating and eventually removing APIs in a controlled manner

### API-First Design

API-first is a development approach where:

- APIs are treated as "first-class citizens"
- API design begins before implementation
- APIs are designed with the consumer's perspective in mind
- Contracts are established early to facilitate parallel development
- APIs are consistent, reusable, and well-documented

### API Security Models

The API Marketplace implements several security models:

- **Authentication**: Verifying the identity of API consumers (OAuth 2.0, JWT, SASL, mTLS)
- **Authorization**: Determining what actions authenticated consumers can perform (RBAC, ABAC)
- **Rate Limiting**: Controlling the number of requests a consumer can make in a given timeframe
- **Threat Protection**: Defending against common API attacks (injection, XSS, etc.)
- **Data Protection**: Ensuring sensitive data is properly secured in transit and at rest

### API Governance

Governance in the API Marketplace includes:

- **Standardization**: Enforcing consistent API design patterns and naming conventions
- **Compliance**: Ensuring APIs meet regulatory requirements (HIPAA, GDPR, etc.)
- **Visibility**: Providing transparency into API usage, performance, and dependencies
- **Versioning**: Managing changes to APIs while maintaining backward compatibility
- **Quality**: Ensuring APIs meet quality standards for reliability, performance, and usability

### North-South vs. East-West Traffic

The API Marketplace handles two primary traffic patterns:

- **North-South Traffic**: Communication between external clients and the platform (consumer/partner APIs)
- **East-West Traffic**: Communication between internal services within the platform (service mesh)

## Glossary
