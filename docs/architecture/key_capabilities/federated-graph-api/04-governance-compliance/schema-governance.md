# Federated Graph API Schema Governance

## Introduction
Schema governance in the Federated Graph API ensures consistency, quality, and compliance across the federated GraphQL schema. This document outlines the principles, processes, and tools employed to maintain a well-governed GraphQL schema that supports business needs while adhering to technical and compliance requirements. Effective schema governance is critical for maintaining a stable, performant, and secure API surface that serves as the foundation for healthcare applications.

## Schema Governance Framework

### Core Principles

1. **Single Source of Truth**
   - The schema registry serves as the authoritative source for all schema definitions
   - All subgraph schemas are registered, versioned, and managed in the registry
   - Schema validation and composition occur through the registry

2. **Federation Alignment**
   - Schema design follows federation best practices
   - Entity boundaries align with subgraph ownership
   - Reference relationships use consistent patterns

3. **Domain Ownership**
   - Each domain team owns its portion of the schema
   - Domain teams have autonomy within governance guidelines
   - Cross-domain types follow clear ownership rules

4. **Backward Compatibility**
   - Breaking changes are avoided whenever possible
   - Deprecation before removal for any breaking changes
   - Versioning strategy for managing evolution

5. **Healthcare Standards Alignment**
   - Alignment with FHIR resource patterns where applicable
   - Support for healthcare interoperability standards
   - Consistent representation of healthcare concepts

### Governance Structure

1. **Schema Governance Board**
   - Representatives from each domain team
   - Technical architects
   - Compliance and security representatives
   - Meets bi-weekly to review and approve significant changes

2. **Schema Custodians**
   - Technical experts responsible for schema quality
   - Review schema change requests
   - Provide guidance on schema design
   - Monitor schema health metrics

3. **Domain Schema Owners**
   - Responsible for their domain's schema
   - Ensure compliance with governance standards
   - Primary reviewers for domain-specific changes
   - Coordinate cross-domain schema changes

4. **API Consumers**
   - Provide feedback on schema usability
   - Submit feature requests for schema enhancements
   - Participate in schema change reviews that impact them
   - Test schema changes before production deployment

## Schema Design Standards

### Naming Conventions

1. **Type Names**
   - PascalCase (e.g., `Patient`, `MedicationStatement`)
   - Singular nouns for entity types
   - Descriptive and aligned with domain terminology
   - FHIR-aligned names for healthcare resources

2. **Field Names**
   - camelCase (e.g., `birthDate`, `medicationCode`)
   - Descriptive verbs for actions/mutations
   - Boolean fields prefixed with "is", "has", or "can"
   - Consistent naming for similar concepts across types

3. **Enum Values**
   - UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES
   - Clear, descriptive names
   - Consistent value patterns
   - Aligned with industry standards where applicable

4. **Argument Names**
   - camelCase
   - Consistent across similar operations
   - Descriptive of the parameter's purpose
   - Standard prefixes/suffixes for common patterns

### Type Design Guidelines

1. **Entity Types**
   - Include a unique `id` field of type `ID!`
   - Use the `@key` directive appropriately
   - Group related fields logically
   - Include documentation for the type and fields

2. **Input Types**
   - Suffix with `Input` (e.g., `PatientInput`)
   - Make fields optional unless required
   - Use sensible defaults where appropriate
   - Include validation rules in documentation

3. **Interface Usage**
   - Use interfaces for shared concepts
   - Implement consistently across types
   - Document interface contract clearly
   - Consider federation implications

4. **Custom Scalars**
   - Create for domain-specific formats
   - Document validation rules
   - Provide examples in descriptions
   - Implement proper serialization/deserialization

### Field Design Guidelines

1. **Nullability**
   - Make fields nullable unless they are truly required
   - Required fields must always have a valid value
   - Consider impact on clients when changing nullability
   - Document when null values are expected/meaningful

2. **Pagination**
   - Use consistent pagination pattern (Cursor-based or Offset-based)
   - Include standard pagination fields (`pageInfo`, `edges`, etc.)
   - Support reasonable page sizes
   - Consider performance implications of large result sets

3. **Filtering**
   - Consistent filter input structure
   - Support common filter operations
   - Document performance implications
   - Consider indexed fields for filterable properties

4. **Healthcare-Specific Fields**
   - Use FHIR-aligned field names where applicable
   - Support standard healthcare coding systems
   - Include narrative/text representations
   - Consider regulatory requirements for sensitive fields

### Documentation Requirements

1. **Type Documentation**
   - Purpose and usage context
   - Relationship to other types
   - Ownership and responsibility
   - Deprecation information if applicable

2. **Field Documentation**
   - Purpose and meaning
   - Format and constraints
   - Examples of valid values
   - Privacy/security considerations for sensitive fields

3. **Mutation Documentation**
   - Purpose and business function
   - Required permissions
   - Success and error responses
   - Side effects and triggers

4. **Query Documentation**
   - Use cases and purpose
   - Performance considerations
   - Filtering and pagination behavior
   - Required permissions

## Schema Management Process

### Schema Change Workflow

1. **Change Initiation**
   - Submit RFC (Request for Comments) for significant changes
   - Create schema change proposal in registry
   - Include business justification
   - Specify backwards compatibility impact

2. **Review Process**
   - Automated schema validation
   - Domain owner review
   - Cross-domain review for shared types
   - Schema custodian review for standards compliance

3. **Approval Gates**
   - Schema Governance Board approval for significant changes
   - Technical architecture review
   - Security and compliance review
   - Performance impact assessment

4. **Implementation**
   - Local development and testing
   - Integration testing with federation
   - Contract testing with consumers
   - Phased deployment strategy

5. **Post-Implementation Review**
   - Validate schema composition
   - Monitor performance metrics
   - Gather consumer feedback
   - Document lessons learned

### Change Classification

1. **Non-Breaking Changes** (Low Risk)
   - Adding optional fields to existing types
   - Adding new types not referenced by existing types
   - Adding new queries or mutations
   - Adding enum values (with caution)

2. **Potentially Breaking Changes** (Medium Risk)
   - Changing field descriptions
   - Deprecating fields or types
   - Changing implementation details that may affect behavior
   - Adding required fields to input types with defaults

3. **Breaking Changes** (High Risk)
   - Removing fields, types, or enum values
   - Changing field types to incompatible types
   - Changing nullability from nullable to non-nullable
   - Changing field arguments

### Versioning Strategy

1. **Field-Level Versioning**
   - Use deprecation for field evolution
   - Include replacement field alongside deprecated field
   - Document migration path in deprecation reason
   - Set timeline for removal

   ```graphql
   type Patient {
     # Original field
     address: String @deprecated(reason: "Use structuredAddress instead, will be removed in Q2 2024")
     
     # Replacement field
     structuredAddress: Address
   }
   ```

2. **Type Versioning**
   - Avoid version numbers in type names
   - Use interfaces for versioning where appropriate
   - Extend types rather than replacing them
   - Document version compatibility

3. **Schema Versioning**
   - Maintain schema version history in registry
   - Track breaking vs. non-breaking changes
   - Support schema versioning at the gateway level
   - Enable client-specified schema version (for critical use cases)

### Deprecation Process

1. **Deprecation Planning**
   - Identify fields/types for deprecation
   - Determine replacement functionality
   - Establish timeline for removal
   - Create migration guides for consumers

2. **Deprecation Implementation**
   - Add `@deprecated` directive with reason
   - Update documentation with migration guidance
   - Communicate deprecation to consumers
   - Monitor usage of deprecated elements

3. **Removal Process**
   - Verify zero or minimal usage
   - Final notification to any remaining consumers
   - Remove deprecated elements according to schedule
   - Document removal in schema changelog
