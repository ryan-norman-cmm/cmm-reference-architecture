# Federated Graph API Architecture

## Introduction
This document outlines the architectural design of the Federated Graph API core component, providing insights into its structure, data flows, and integration patterns. The Federated Graph API is built on Apollo Federation to provide a unified GraphQL interface across the CoverMyMeds Technology Platform.

## Architectural Overview
The Federated Graph API implements a federated GraphQL architecture that unifies multiple subgraphs into a cohesive supergraph. This composition layer enables clients to query data across service boundaries through a single endpoint while maintaining service autonomy and separation of concerns.

The architecture follows a distributed gateway pattern where the Apollo Router intelligently routes and delegates portions of queries to the appropriate backend services based on their schema contributions. This approach balances the benefits of a monolithic API (unified access) with those of microservices (independent development and deployment).

## Component Structure

### Gateway Layer
- **Apollo Router**: High-performance gateway that routes GraphQL operations
- **Composition Engine**: Combines subgraph schemas into a supergraph
- **Query Planner**: Creates execution plans for incoming queries
- **Query Executor**: Delegates query fragments to appropriate subgraphs
- **Response Assembler**: Combines subgraph responses into a unified result

### Management Layer
- **Apollo GraphOS**: Platform for managing and monitoring the federated graph
- **Schema Registry**: Tracks and validates schema changes
- **Metrics Collection**: Captures performance and usage data
- **Operation Registry**: Manages and validates client operations

### Subgraph Layer
- **FHIR Subgraph**: Exposes healthcare data from the FHIR Platform
- **User Subgraph**: Manages user profiles and preferences
- **Workflow Subgraph**: Exposes workflow state and operations
- **Reference Data Subgraph**: Provides access to shared reference data
- **Analytics Subgraph**: Offers reporting and analytics capabilities

### Client Layer
- **Apollo Client**: Frontend integration library for React applications
- **Code Generation**: Type-safe GraphQL operation utilities
- **Cache Management**: Client-side data caching and synchronization
- **Error Handling**: Standardized error processing

## Data Flow

1. **Query Execution Flow**:
   - Client submits GraphQL operation to the Router
   - Router validates the operation against the schema
   - Query planner creates an execution plan
   - Router delegates query fragments to appropriate subgraphs
   - Subgraphs execute their portions and return results
   - Router assembles the complete response
   - Final response is returned to the client

2. **Mutation Flow**:
   - Client submits mutation to the Router
   - Router validates the mutation against the schema
   - Mutation is routed to the responsible subgraph
   - Subgraph executes the mutation and returns the result
   - Router forwards the result to the client
   - Client updates its local cache

3. **Subscription Flow**:
   - Client initiates subscription connection
   - Router establishes WebSocket connection
   - Subscription is registered with relevant subgraphs
   - When events occur, subgraphs push updates
   - Router forwards updates to the client
   - Client processes real-time updates

4. **Entity Resolution Flow**:
   - Query requests entity fields from multiple subgraphs
   - Router fetches the entity from its primary subgraph
   - Router identifies fields needed from other subgraphs
   - Router queries other subgraphs with entity references
   - Entity data is assembled from all subgraphs
   - Complete entity is included in the response

## Design Patterns

- **Schema-First Development**: Defining the schema before implementation
- **Entity References**: Sharing entities across subgraph boundaries
- **Type Extensions**: Adding fields to types from multiple subgraphs
- **Schema Federation**: Composing schemas from autonomous services
- **Resolver Chaining**: Building complex resolvers from simpler ones
- **DataLoader Pattern**: Batching and caching database queries
- **Query Depth Limiting**: Preventing excessive query complexity
