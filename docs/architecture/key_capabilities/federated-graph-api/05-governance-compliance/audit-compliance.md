# Federated Graph API Audit Compliance

## Introduction
The Federated Graph API implements a comprehensive audit framework to meet regulatory requirements, security best practices, and organizational compliance needs. This document outlines the audit compliance mechanisms, controls, data collection processes, and review procedures implemented within the Federated Graph API to ensure appropriate tracking and accountability for all actions affecting healthcare data.

## Audit Framework

### Compliance Standards

The Federated Graph API audit framework is designed to support compliance with the following standards and regulations:

| Standard/Regulation | Compliance Areas | Key Requirements |
|---------------------|------------------|------------------|
| **HIPAA Security Rule** | Access control, audit controls, integrity | Complete audit trails for PHI access, user identification, timestamps |
| **HITRUST CSF** | Access management, logging and monitoring | Access attempts, privileged actions, security events |
| **SOC 2** | Access control, monitoring, risk management | User activity, system changes, anomaly detection |
| **GDPR** (where applicable) | Data subject rights, processing records | Data access, modification, deletion logs |
| **21 CFR Part 11** (for pharmaceutical features) | Electronic signatures, audit trails | Complete, system-generated audit trails with timestamp and user identity |
| **CMS Interoperability Rule** | API access and usage | API utilization, patient data access |

### Audit Scope

The audit framework captures events across multiple layers of the Federated Graph API:

1. **Gateway Layer**
   - Authentication events
   - Authorization decisions
   - Request validation
   - Query execution

2. **Subgraph Layer**
   - Entity resolution
   - Data access
   - Operation execution
   - Error conditions

3. **Data Persistence**
   - Data mutations
   - Schema changes
   - Entity creation/modification/deletion

4. **Administrative Actions**
   - Schema registry updates
   - Configuration changes
   - User role/permission changes
   - System maintenance

### Audit Categories

The audit framework captures the following categories of events:

| Category | Description | Examples |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Authentication** | User identity verification | Login attempts, token validation, session management |
| **Authorization** | Access control decisions | Permission checks, role verification, policy decisions |
| **Data Access** | Reading of healthcare data | Patient record views, medication list retrieval |
| **Data Modification** | Changes to healthcare data | Patient updates, medication orders, appointment creation |
| **Schema Changes** | Modifications to the GraphQL schema | Field additions, type changes, schema deployments |
| **System Configuration** | Changes to system settings | Policy updates, environment changes, integration settings |
| **Security Events** | Security-related incidents | Unauthorized access attempts, policy violations |
| **Performance Events** | System performance information | Query timeouts, resource constraints, rate limiting |
