# Federated Graph API Data Governance

## Introduction
This document outlines the data governance framework for the Federated Graph API, establishing principles, roles, responsibilities, and policies for managing healthcare data across the federated GraphQL system. Effective data governance ensures data quality, security, compliance, and consistency throughout the organization while enabling teams to work autonomously within a unified data ecosystem.

## Governance Principles

### Data Quality Principles

1. **Accuracy**
   - Data represented in the Federated Graph API must accurately reflect source system records
   - Validation checks must be implemented at both source and federation layers
   - Schema constraints should enforce data type and format correctness

2. **Completeness**
   - Required data fields must always be populated with valid values
   - Nullable fields must have clear documentation on when null values are acceptable
   - Missing data should be distinguished from unknown or null data

3. **Consistency**
   - Data representations must be consistent across subgraphs
   - Reference data (e.g., FHIR coding systems) must be standardized
   - Common healthcare concepts must use consistent formats and units

4. **Timeliness**
   - Data must be updated within defined SLAs based on data criticality
   - Real-time data should be clearly distinguished from periodically updated data
   - Cache invalidation policies must ensure data currency meets clinical requirements

5. **Integrity**
   - Relationships between entities must maintain referential integrity
   - Schema constraints must enforce structural integrity
   - Data validation must ensure semantic integrity

### Data Stewardship Principles

1. **Ownership**
   - Each domain and subgraph has clearly defined data owners
   - Data ownership boundaries align with organizational responsibilities
   - Data owners are accountable for quality and governance within their domain

2. **Accessibility**
   - Data access follows role-based authorization rules
   - Data accessibility balances security with legitimate business needs
   - PHI access follows minimum necessary principle

3. **Transparency**
   - Data lineage is tracked and documented
   - Metadata explains data sources, transformations, and meaning
   - Data definitions are clear and consistent

4. **Security**
   - Data is protected according to its classification
   - Access controls are enforced consistently
   - Data security follows defense-in-depth approach

### Compliance Principles

1. **HIPAA Compliance**
   - PHI handling follows all HIPAA requirements
   - Appropriate safeguards are in place for PHI
   - Data access is limited to minimum necessary

2. **Healthcare Regulations**
   - API implements relevant healthcare data exchange standards
   - Clinical data representation follows recognized standards (FHIR, LOINC, SNOMED)
   - State-specific healthcare privacy rules are enforced

3. **Auditability**
   - All data access and modifications are logged
   - Audit trails are comprehensive and tamper-resistant
   - Audit data is retained according to regulatory requirements
