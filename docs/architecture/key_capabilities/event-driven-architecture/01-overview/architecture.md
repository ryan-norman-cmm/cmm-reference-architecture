# Event-Driven Architecture Design

## Introduction
This document outlines the architectural design of the Event-Driven Architecture capability, providing insights into its structure, implementation patterns, and integration approaches. The Event-Driven Architecture provides a comprehensive framework for building real-time, resilient, and loosely coupled systems across the healthcare ecosystem.

## Architectural Overview
The Event-Driven Architecture capability serves as the communication backbone and processing framework for the CoverMyMeds Technology Platform, enabling asynchronous, event-driven communication and complex event processing across components and external systems. It implements multiple architectural patterns that work together to create a reactive, resilient platform that can respond to healthcare events in real time.

The architecture is designed as a layered system, with each layer providing specific capabilities that build upon the lower layers, allowing teams to adopt parts of the stack that match their specific needs.

## Architectural Patterns

### Event Sourcing
Event Sourcing is a pattern where application state changes are captured as a sequence of immutable events.

**Key Implementation Components:**
- **Event Store**: Persistent, append-only log of all events
- **Event Serialization**: Standardized event representation formats (JSON, Avro)
- **Aggregation Logic**: Reconstruction of current state from event sequences
- **Snapshotting**: Performance optimization for state reconstruction
- **Event Replay**: Ability to reconstruct state at any point in time

**Healthcare Application Examples:**
- Patient medical history as an event log
- Medication adherence tracking through medication events
- Prior authorization workflow as a series of state change events

### Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)
CQRS separates read and write operations to optimize for different requirements.

**Key Implementation Components:**
- **Command Handlers**: Process commands and emit events
- **Event Handlers**: Update read models based on events
- **Read Models**: Optimized data structures for specific query needs
- **Materialized Views**: Pre-computed views derived from event streams
- **Projection Managers**: Coordinate updating of read models

**Healthcare Application Examples:**
- Patient 360Â° views with specialized read models for different healthcare roles
- High-performance clinical dashboards with pre-aggregated metrics
- Real-time reporting on healthcare workflows

### Stream Processing
Stream Processing enables continuous computation on event streams.

**Key Implementation Components:**
- **Stream Processors**: Kafka Streams applications for stateful processing
- **Stream-Table Joins**: Enriching events with reference data
- **Windowing Operations**: Time-based grouping of event streams
- **State Stores**: Persistent storage for stream processing state
- **Processor Topologies**: Interconnected processing stages for complex transformations

**Healthcare Application Examples:**
- Real-time clinical alerting based on vital sign stream analysis
- Medication interaction detection from prescription events
- Care gap identification from patient event streams

### Event Choreography
Event Choreography coordinates distributed workflows through decentralized event exchange.

**Key Implementation Components:**
- **Event-Based Services**: Microservices that react to and emit events
- **Event Standards**: Consistent event formats and semantics
- **Service Discovery**: Dynamic discovery of event producers and consumers
- **Correlation Identifiers**: Linking related events across services
- **Compensating Events**: Handling failure cases through event-based recovery

**Healthcare Application Examples:**
- Coordinating care team actions through events
- Managing medication fulfillment across multiple systems
- Decentralized prior authorization workflow management

### Event Orchestration
Event Orchestration provides centralized coordination of complex workflows.

**Key Implementation Components:**
- **Workflow Engine**: Central coordinator for multi-step processes
- **Process Definitions**: Declarative workflow specifications
- **State Management**: Tracking workflow state across events
- **Timeout Handling**: Managing workflow timeouts and escalations
