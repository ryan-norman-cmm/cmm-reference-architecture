# Documentation Review Plan for Core Components (Excluding Workflow Orchestration Engine)

## Objective
Systematically review and update all required documentation artifacts for each core component of the CMM Technology Platform (excluding Workflow Orchestration Engine) to ensure:
- Full compliance with documentation standardization rules
- Consistency, clarity, and completeness
- Alignment with the latest approved templates
- Highest standards of technical communication and usability

## Core Components in Scope
- API Marketplace
- Design System
- FHIR Interoperability Platform
- Event Broker
- Federated Graph API

## Required Documentation Artifacts (per component)
- 01-getting-started/
  - overview.md
  - key-concepts.md
  - architecture.md
- 02-getting-started/
  - quick-start.md
  - local-setup.md
- 03-core-functionality/
  - core-apis.md (if applicable)
  - data-model.md (if applicable)
- 04-advanced-patterns/
  - advanced-use-cases.md (if applicable)
  - customization.md (if applicable)
- 05-governance-compliance/
  - access-controls.md
  - data-governance.md
  - audit-compliance.md
  - regulatory-compliance.md
- 06-operations/
  - deployment.md
  - monitoring.md
  - scaling.md
  - troubleshooting.md
  - maintenance.md
- Additional: Any other component-specific required docs

## Review/Validation Steps
1. **Inventory**: List all documentation artifacts for each core component.
2. **Template Alignment**: Check each artifact for compliance with the latest template (structure, headings, required sections).
3. **Content Quality**: Assess clarity, completeness, technical accuracy, and consistency. Ensure extraneous content that does not add value to the topic of the page is not included.
4. **Diagram Validation**: Ensure all required diagrams are present, up-to-date, and in mermaid or approved format.
5. **Cross-Referencing**: Validate all internal and external links, references, and cross-component documentation pointers.
6. **Style & Language**: Enforce concise, actionable, and healthcare-appropriate language.
7. **Compliance & Security**: Confirm documentation references security, compliance, and regulatory concerns where relevant (e.g., HIPAA, RBAC, Zero Trust).
8. **Review Checklist**: Use a checklist for each artifact to confirm:
   - [ ] Template compliance
   - [ ] Section completeness
   - [ ] Code and diagram accuracy
   - [ ] Link validity
   - [ ] Language and style
   - [ ] Security/compliance notes

## Deliverables
- Updated, standardized documentation for each artifact
- Completed review checklist for each artifact (to be tracked in a separate review log or table)
- Summary report of gaps, issues, and recommended improvements

## Timeline & Ownership
- **Phase 1:** Inventory and initial review
- **Phase 2:** Remediation and updates
- **Phase 3:** Final review and sign-off
- **Owners:** Documentation lead + component technical leads

## Example Review Checklist (per artifact)
| Artifact                | Template | Complete | Code/Diagrams | Links | Style | Security |
|-------------------------|----------|----------|---------------|-------|-------|----------|
| overview.md             |    [ ]   |   [ ]    |     [ ]       | [ ]   | [ ]   |   [ ]    |
| quick-start.md          |    [ ]   |   [ ]    |     [ ]       | [ ]   | [ ]   |   [ ]    |
| architecture.md         |    [ ]   |   [ ]    |     [ ]       | [ ]   | [ ]   |   [ ]    |
| ...                     |    [ ]   |   [ ]    |     [ ]       | [ ]   | [ ]   |   [ ]    |

## Notes
- Workflow Orchestration Engine is excluded from this review cycle.
- Use the doc-standardization-rules.md for template and content guidelines.
- All updates should be tracked in version control with clear commit messages referencing the review plan.
