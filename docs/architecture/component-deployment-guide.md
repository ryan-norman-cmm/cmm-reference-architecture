# Core Component Deployment Guide

## Introduction

This document outlines the release lifecycle and CI/CD processes for each core component of the CMM Technology Platform, focusing on their specific deployable objects. Understanding the unique deployment characteristics of each component is essential for effective integration, testing, and operational management.

Each core component produces different types of deployable artifacts based on its function and architecture. This guide provides a standardized approach to managing these diverse deployables while maintaining consistency across the platform.

## Common Release Lifecycle

While each component has unique deployable objects, all follow a common release lifecycle pattern:

### Lifecycle Stages

1. **Planning**
   - Requirements gathering and prioritization
   - Roadmap development
   - Resource allocation

2. **Development**
   - Implementation of features
   - Unit and integration testing
   - Documentation updates

3. **Testing**
   - Functional testing
   - Performance testing
   - Security testing
   - Compliance validation

4. **Release**
   - Creation of component-specific deployable objects
   - Final validation
   - Deployment to target environments
   - Release communication

5. **Maintenance**
   - Bug fixes and patches
   - Security updates
   - Performance optimizations

6. **Deprecation**
   - Deprecation announcements
   - Migration guidance
   - End-of-life planning

### Versioning Strategy

All components follow semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH):

- **Major Version (X.0.0)**: Incompatible changes requiring migration
- **Minor Version (0.X.0)**: New backward-compatible functionality
- **Patch Version (0.0.X)**: Backward-compatible bug fixes and minor improvements
