### Implementation Priority

1. **High Priority (Phase 2)**
   - Create standard templates for all document types
   - Rename non-standard files to follow conventions
   - Consolidate redundant documentation

2. **Medium Priority (Phase 3)**
   - Create missing critical documentation:
     - architecture.md for all components
     - core-apis.md for all components
     - deployment.md for all components
     - component-specific required documents

3. **Lower Priority (Phase 4)**
   - Create remaining standard documentation
   - Implement cross-referencing between documents
   - Add advanced documentation elements

## Next Steps

1. Create standard templates for all document types
2. Implement folder structure standardization
3. Begin documentation creation and updates based on priority
