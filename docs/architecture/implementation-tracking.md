## Implementation Execution Plan

### Phase 1: Standardization Foundation (Immediate)
1. Create templates for all required standard documents
2. Rename existing files to follow conventions:
   - Rename all setup-guide.md to quick-start.md
   - Consolidate redundant content (benefits-overview.md → overview.md)
   - Map component-specific monitoring docs to standard operations structure
3. Remove redundant files after consolidation:
   - Delete files whose content has been consolidated into standard documents
   - Ensure all cross-references are updated before deletion
   - Document removed files in the implementation tracking

### Phase 2: Critical Documentation Creation
1. Create the following high-priority missing documents for each component:
   - architecture.md (all components)
   - key-concepts.md (all components)
   - core-apis.md (all components)
   - data-model.md (all components)
   - deployment.md (for components missing it)
2. Enhance component-specific governance docs to ensure they address component-specific concerns

### Phase 3: Complete Documentation
1. Create remaining standard documents:
   - integration-points.md
   - advanced-use-cases.md, extension-points.md, customization.md
   - missing operations docs (monitoring.md, scaling.md, troubleshooting.md, etc.)

### Phase 4: Quality and Cross-Referencing
1. Implement cross-references between documents
2. Validate documentation against the standardization plan checklist
3. Establish regular review cycles to keep documentation current

This approach prioritizes getting consistent structure first, then filling critical gaps, followed by completing the full documentation set.


### Implementation Priority

1. **High Priority (Phase 2)**
   - Create standard templates for all document types
   - Rename non-standard files to follow conventions
   - Consolidate redundant documentation

2. **Medium Priority (Phase 3)**
   - Create missing or update existing critical documentation:
     - architecture.md for all components
     - core-apis.md for all components
     - deployment.md for all components
     - component-specific required documents

3. **Lower Priority (Phase 4)**
   - Create remaining standard documentation
   - Implement cross-referencing between documents
   - Add advanced documentation elements

## Next Steps

1. Create standard templates for all document types
2. Implement folder structure standardization
3. Begin documentation creation and updates based on priority
