# Core Component Documentation Standards

## Introduction

This document defines the mandatory standards for all CMM Technology Platform core component documentation. These standards ensure consistency, completeness, and quality across all components, making the documentation more accessible and useful for developers, architects, and other stakeholders. All contributors **must** follow these standards when creating or updating documentation.

## Documentation Structure

### Tier-Based Organization

All core components **must** follow a consistent 5-tier documentation structure. No exceptions or deviations are permitted without explicit approval from the architecture team.

1. **01-getting-started**: Introduction, quick start guides, and basic concepts
   - Purpose: Help new users understand the component and get started quickly
   - Target audience: New developers, architects, and stakeholders
   - Required files: overview.md, quick-start.md, key-concepts.md, architecture.md

2. **02-core-functionality**: Core features, main APIs, and primary use cases
   - Purpose: Document the core capabilities and interfaces of the component
   - Target audience: Developers implementing or integrating with the component
   - Required files: core-apis.md, data-model.md, integration-points.md

3. **03-advanced-patterns**: Advanced usage patterns, integrations, and complex scenarios

## Document Templates and Content Guidelines

### Standard Document Structure

All documentation **must** adhere to the following structure:

1. **Title (H1)**: Clear, descriptive title using the format `# [Component Name] [Document Topic]`
   - Example: `# FHIR Interoperability Platform Architecture`
   - Must be the first element in the document
   - Must be the only H1 heading in the document

2. **Introduction (H2)**: Brief overview of the document's purpose and scope
   - Must begin with `## Introduction`
   - Should be 2-4 paragraphs explaining what the document covers and why it matters
   - Should identify the target audience
   - Should not exceed 200 words

3. **Main Content (H2/H3/H4)**: Organized in logical sections with clear hierarchical headings
   - Use H2 (`##`) for main sections
   - Use H3 (`###`) for subsections
   - Use H4 (`####`) for detailed topics within subsections
   - Each heading should be concise and descriptive
   - Headings should follow a logical progression
   - Section titles should not reference technology unless it is the primary focus

4. **Code Examples**: All technical documents must include TypeScript code examples
   - Use fenced code blocks with language specification: \```typescript
   - Include comments to explain complex code
   - Ensure code examples are complete and runnable when possible
   - Include error handling, monitoring, and observability in code examples
   - **Use TypeScript for all web and Node.js related code examples**

5. **Diagrams**: Complex concepts should be illustrated with diagrams
   - Use mermaid diagrams for consistency
   - Include both the diagram and the source code
   - Diagrams should have clear labels and a logical flow
   - Include a brief explanation of the diagram

6. **Conclusion or Summary (H2)**: Recap of key points
   - Should begin with `## Summary` or `## Conclusion`
   - Should highlight the most important takeaways
   - Should not introduce new information

7. **Related Resources (H2)**: Links to related documentation
   - Must begin with `## Related Resources`
   - Should include links to related documents within the component
   - Should include links to relevant documents in other components
   - Use relative links when linking to other documents in the repository

### Content Focus and Avoiding Redundancy

To ensure documentation is focused, effective, and minimizes redundancy, follow these principles:

1. **Single Responsibility Principle**
   - Each document must have a clear, singular focus
   - If a document covers multiple topics, consider splitting it into separate documents
   - The document's title and introduction should clearly define its scope

2. **Cross-Reference Instead of Duplicate**
   - Never duplicate content across multiple documents
   - Use links to reference information in other documents
   - Format links as `[descriptive text](relative/path/to/document.md)`
   - Ensure all links are valid and point to the correct location

3. **Component-Specific Content**
   - Focus on component-specific implementations rather than general concepts
   - When discussing general concepts, relate them directly to the component
   - Avoid lengthy explanations of industry-standard concepts
   - Link to authoritative external resources for general concepts

4. **Appropriate Detail Level**
   - Match the detail level to the document's purpose and audience
   - Getting-started documents should be high-level and accessible
   - Technical documents should include detailed explanations and code examples
   - Operations documents should include step-by-step procedures

5. **Consistent Terminology**
   - Use consistent terminology across all documents
   - Define terms on first use with a clear, concise definition
   - Follow industry-standard terminology when applicable
   - Maintain a glossary of terms in the key-concepts.md document

### Communication and Documentation

### Communication Platform Standards

All documentation must reference Microsoft Teams as the standard communication platform:

- Use "Microsoft Teams channel" instead of "Slack channel" in all documentation
- Use "teams_configs" instead of "slack_configs" in all monitoring configurations
- Use "teams" instead of "slack" in notification channel references
- Use the "teams" field instead of "slack" in team contact information

### What Should and Should Not Be Included

The following guidelines help determine what content belongs in each document:

| Document Type | Should Include | Should Not Include |
|--------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Overview | Component purpose, key features, high-level architecture, primary use cases | Detailed implementation, code examples, configuration details |
| Architecture | Component design, internal structure, data flow, integration points | Detailed code examples, step-by-step tutorials, operational procedures |
| API Documentation | API endpoints, parameters, return values, error codes, usage examples | Internal implementation details, deployment procedures, general concepts |
| Tutorials | Step-by-step instructions, specific use cases, expected outcomes | Comprehensive API references, architectural details, theoretical concepts |
| Reference Architecture | System-wide architecture, component relationships, design patterns, architectural decisions | Component-specific implementation details, code examples, operational procedures |

Reference architecture documentation should be reserved for system-wide architectural documentation and should not be duplicated in component-specific documentation. Component documentation should reference the system architecture rather than reproducing it.

## Implementation and Compliance

### Documentation Review Process

All documentation changes must go through a formal review process to ensure compliance with these standards:

1. **Self-Review Checklist**
   - Before submitting documentation, authors must complete a self-review using the [Documentation Standards Checklist](../templates/documentation-checklist.md)
   - The checklist must be included in the pull request description

2. **Peer Review**
   - All documentation changes require at least one review from a peer
   - Reviewers must verify compliance with these standards
   - Reviewers should use the Documentation Standards Checklist as a guide

3. **Technical Accuracy Review**
   - Documentation for technical components requires a review from a subject matter expert
   - The technical reviewer must verify the accuracy of all technical content
   - Code examples must be validated for correctness and adherence to best practices

4. **Final Approval**
   - Documentation changes require final approval from a documentation maintainer
   - Maintainers are responsible for ensuring consistency across all documentation

### Tools and Automation

The following tools and automation are in place to help maintain documentation standards:

1. **Markdown Linting**
   - All markdown files are automatically linted using markdownlint
   - Configuration is in the `.markdownlint.json` file in the repository root
   - Pull requests will fail CI checks if linting errors are present

2. **Documentation Structure Validation**
   - Automated checks verify the required folder structure and files
   - Pull requests will fail CI checks if required files are missing

3. **Link Validation**
   - Automated checks verify that all internal links are valid
   - Broken links must be fixed before merging

4. **Template Generator**
   - Use the template generator script to create new documentation files:
   - `node scripts/create-doc-template.js <component-name> <doc-type> <file-name>`
   - Example: `node scripts/create-doc-template.js fhir-interoperability-platform 01-getting-started overview.md`

### Handling Exceptions

In rare cases, exceptions to these standards may be necessary. The process for handling exceptions is:

1. **Exception Request**
   - Submit an exception request to the architecture team
   - Include a detailed justification for the exception
   - Specify which standards cannot be met and why

2. **Review and Approval**
   - The architecture team will review the exception request
   - Exceptions require approval from at least two architecture team members
   - Approved exceptions will be documented in the implementation tracking document

3. **Documentation**
   - All approved exceptions must be documented in the affected files
   - Include a comment at the top of the file explaining the exception
   - Reference the exception approval in the pull request

### Measuring Compliance

Compliance with documentation standards is measured and tracked:

1. **Documentation Coverage Report**
   - A weekly report shows documentation coverage for each component
   - Coverage is measured as a percentage of required documents that exist
   - The report is available in the documentation dashboard

2. **Quality Metrics**
   - Documentation quality is measured using automated tools
   - Metrics include readability scores, broken links, and linting errors
   - Quality scores are included in the documentation dashboard

3. **Implementation Tracking**
   - The [Implementation Tracking](implementation-tracking.md) document tracks progress toward full compliance
   - Each component is assessed for compliance with these standards
   - The tracking document is updated monthly

## Deployable Objects Documentation

## Conclusion

This documentation standardization plan provides a comprehensive approach to ensuring consistent, high-quality documentation across all components of the CMM Technology Platform. By following this plan, we will create a unified documentation experience that enhances usability, maintainability, and compliance.

The implementation of this plan should be treated as a project with clear phases, responsibilities, and timelines. Regular reviews and updates to the documentation will ensure it remains accurate and valuable as the architecture evolves.

By removing redundant documentation, restructuring misaligned content, and enforcing clear content boundaries, we will create a more maintainable and useful documentation set that better serves the needs of all stakeholders.
