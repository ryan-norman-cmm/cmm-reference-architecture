# Key Capability Documentation Standards

## Introduction

This document defines the mandatory standards for all CMM Technology Platform key capability documentation. These standards ensure consistency, completeness, and quality across all capabilities, making the documentation more accessible and useful for developers, architects, and other stakeholders. All contributors **must** follow these standards when creating or updating documentation.

## Documentation Structure

### Tier-Based Organization

All key capabilities **must** follow a consistent 5-tier documentation structure. No exceptions or deviations are permitted without explicit approval from the architecture team.

1. **01-getting-started**: Introduction, quick start guides, and basic concepts
   - Purpose: Help new users understand the component and get started quickly
   - Target audience: New developers, architects, and stakeholders
   - Required files: overview.md, quick-start.md, key-concepts.md, architecture.md

2. **02-core-functionality**: Core features, main APIs, and primary use cases
   - Purpose: Document the core capabilities and interfaces of the component
   - Target audience: Developers implementing or integrating with the component
   - Required files: core-apis.md, data-model.md

3. **03-advanced-patterns**: Advanced usage patterns, integrations, and complex scenarios
   - Purpose: Document advanced usage scenarios and extension mechanisms
   - Target audience: Experienced developers customizing or extending the component
   - Required files: advanced-use-cases.md, customization.md

4. **04-governance-compliance**: Governance frameworks, compliance considerations, and security controls
   - Purpose: Document governance, security, and compliance aspects
   - Target audience: Security specialists, compliance officers, and architects
   - Required files: access-controls.md, data-governance.md, audit-compliance.md, regulatory-compliance.md

5. **05-operations**: Deployment, monitoring, scaling, and maintenance
   - Purpose: Document operational aspects of the component
   - Target audience: DevOps engineers, SREs, and system administrators
   - Required files: deployment.md, monitoring.md, scaling.md, troubleshooting.md, maintenance.md

### Folder Structure

Each capability must maintain the following folder structure:

```
/docs/architecture/key_capabilities/[capability-name]/
├── 01-getting-started/
│   ├── overview.md
│   ├── quick-start.md
│   ├── key-concepts.md
│   └── architecture.md

    ├── scaling.md
    ├── troubleshooting.md
    └── maintenance.md
```

## Template Usage Requirement

All new documentation (including but not limited to overview, quick start, architecture, and advanced topics) **must** be created using the official templates provided in the `/docs/architecture/templates/` folder. Each documentation type (e.g., overview, quick start, etc.) has a corresponding template that must be followed to ensure consistency, completeness, and compliance with CMM documentation standards.

- Deviations from the templates are not permitted unless explicitly reviewed and approved by the documentation governance team or project lead.
- Templates must be updated centrally, and any changes to template structure should be communicated to all documentation contributors.

## Document Templates and Content Guidelines

### Document Templates

All documentation **must** follow the appropriate template from the templates directory. These templates provide detailed guidance on structure, content, and formatting for each document type:

| Document Type | Template | Purpose |
|--------------|----------|---------|
| Overview | [overview-template.md](../templates/overview-template.md) | Component introduction and high-level information |
| Quick Start | [quick-start-template.md](../templates/quick-start-template.md) | Fast setup and first-use guidance |
| Key Concepts | [key-concepts-template.md](../templates/key-concepts-template.md) | Terminology, glossary, and foundational ideas |
| Architecture | [architecture-template.md](../templates/architecture-template.md) | Component design and structure |
| Core APIs | [core-apis-template.md](../templates/core-apis-template.md) | Main API endpoints and usage |
| Data Model | [data-model-template.md](../templates/data-model-template.md) | Data structures and relationships |
| Feature-Specific | [feature-specific-template.md](../templates/feature-specific-template.md) | Documentation for unique or optional features |
| Advanced Use Cases | [advanced-use-cases-template.md](../templates/advanced-use-cases-template.md) | Complex usage scenarios and workflows |
| Customization | [customization-template.md](../templates/customization-template.md) | Configuration and extension options |
| Advanced Feature | [advanced-feature-template.md](../templates/advanced-feature-template.md) | Deep dives into advanced component features |
| Access Controls | [access-controls-template.md](../templates/access-controls-template.md) | RBAC, policy enforcement, and authentication |
| Data Governance | [data-governance-template.md](../templates/data-governance-template.md) | Data quality, lifecycle, and stewardship |
| Audit Compliance | [audit-compliance-template.md](../templates/audit-compliance-template.md) | Audit controls and IT general controls |
| Regulatory Compliance | [regulatory-compliance-template.md](../templates/regulatory-compliance-template.md) | Compliance with regulations |
| Monitoring | [monitoring-template.md](../templates/monitoring-template.md) | Metrics, logging, and alerting |
| Scaling | [scaling-template.md](../templates/scaling-template.md) | Scaling strategies and operational procedures |
| Troubleshooting | [troubleshooting-template.md](../templates/troubleshooting-template.md) | Actionable troubleshooting steps for component-specific issues |
| Maintenance | [maintenance-template.md](../templates/maintenance-template.md) | Routine operations, upgrades, and support |

### Standard Document Structure

All documentation **must** adhere to the following structure, which is reflected in the templates:

1. **Title (H1)**: Clear, descriptive title using the format `# [Component Name] [Document Topic]`
2. **Introduction (H2)**: Brief overview of the document's purpose and scope
3. **Main Content (H2/H3/H4)**: Organized in logical sections with clear hierarchical headings
4. **Code Examples**: TypeScript code examples where applicable
5. **Diagrams**: Mermaid diagrams only when they directly clarify a complex operational process or are essential for understanding escalation, flow, or architecture. Avoid diagrams unless they provide clear, actionable value to the reader.
6. **Conclusion or Summary (H2)**: Recap of key points
7. **Related Resources (H2)**: Links to related documentation

Refer to the specific template for each document type for detailed guidance on structure and content.

---

### Content Focus and Avoiding Redundancy

To ensure documentation is focused, effective, and minimizes redundancy, follow these principles:

1. **Single Responsibility Principle**
   - Each document must have a clear, singular focus
   - If a document covers multiple topics, consider splitting it into separate documents
   - The document's title and introduction should clearly define its scope

2. **Cross-Reference Instead of Duplicate**
   - Never duplicate content across multiple documents
   - Use links to reference information in other documents
   - Format links as `[descriptive text](relative/path/to/document.md)`
   - Ensure all links are valid and point to the correct location

3. **Component-Specific Content**
   - Focus on component-specific implementations rather than general concepts
   - When discussing general concepts, relate them directly to the component
   - Avoid lengthy explanations of industry-standard concepts
   - Link to authoritative external resources for general concepts

4. **Appropriate Detail Level**
   - Match the detail level to the document's purpose and audience
   - Getting-started documents should be high-level and accessible
   - Technical documents should include detailed explanations and code examples
   - Operations documents should include step-by-step procedures

5. **Consistent Terminology**
   - Use consistent terminology across all documents
   - Define terms on first use with a clear, concise definition
   - Follow industry-standard terminology when applicable
   - Maintain a glossary of terms in the key-concepts.md document

### Communication and Documentation

### Communication Platform Standards

All documentation must reference Microsoft Teams as the standard communication platform:

- Use "Microsoft Teams channel" instead of "Slack channel" in all documentation
- Use "teams_configs" instead of "slack_configs" in all monitoring configurations
- Use "teams" instead of "slack" in notification channel references
- Use the "teams" field instead of "slack" in team contact information

### What Should and Should Not Be Included

The following guidelines help determine what content belongs in each document:

| Document Type | Should Include | Should Not Include |
|--------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Overview | Component purpose, key features, high-level architecture, primary use cases | Detailed implementation, code examples, configuration details |
| Architecture | Component design, internal structure, data flow, integration points | Detailed code examples, step-by-step tutorials, operational procedures |
| API Documentation | API endpoints, parameters, return values, error codes, usage examples | Internal implementation details, deployment procedures, general concepts |
| Tutorials | Step-by-step instructions, specific use cases, expected outcomes | Comprehensive API references, architectural details, theoretical concepts |
| Reference Architecture | System-wide architecture, component relationships, design patterns, architectural decisions | Component-specific implementation details, code examples, operational procedures |

Reference architecture documentation should be reserved for system-wide architectural documentation and should not be duplicated in component-specific documentation. Component documentation should reference the system architecture rather than reproducing it.

5. Remove any sections that are not applicable (with justification)
6. Add component-specific sections as needed

## Content Standards

### Vendor Documentation Links

- When available and appropriate to share, always include a link to the official vendor documentation for any commercial or open-source product used by the component (e.g., Confluent Kafka, Aidbox, Apollo GraphOS, Okta, MuleSoft, etc.).
- Vendor documentation links must point to the most relevant page for the specific product, feature, or API being referenced—not just the vendor's home page or general documentation index.
- Vendor documentation links should be provided in context, typically in the 'Related Resources' section or alongside the first mention of the vendor product.
- Do not include vendor documentation links for internal, proprietary, or confidential vendor resources unless explicitly permitted.

### Writing Style

All documentation **must** follow these writing style guidelines:

- **Clear and Concise Language**
  - Use simple, direct language
  - Avoid jargon and unnecessary technical terms
  - Explain complex concepts in simple terms
  - Keep sentences short (25 words or less)
  - Use bullet points for lists and steps

- **Consistent Tense and Voice**
  - Write in present tense ("The system sends a message" not "The system will send a message")
  - Use active voice ("The component processes the request" not "The request is processed by the component")
  - Use second person ("you") when addressing the reader in instructional content
  - Use imperative mood for instructions ("Click the button" not "You should click the button")

- **Formatting and Structure**
  - Use headings to organize content hierarchically
  - Keep paragraphs short (3-5 sentences)
  - Use bold for emphasis sparingly
  - Use code formatting for code elements, file names, and technical terms
  - Define acronyms on first use: "Health Level Seven (HL7) FHIR"

- **Inclusive Language**
  - Use gender-neutral language
  - Avoid culturally specific metaphors or idioms
  - Consider international audiences (avoid region-specific terms)
  - Follow the [Microsoft Writing Style Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/) for inclusive language

### Code Examples

All technical documentation **must** include code examples that follow these guidelines:

- **Language and Format**
  - **Use TypeScript for all web and Node.js related code examples**
  - Use strongly-typed interfaces and classes
  - Use the vendor's preferred language only when TypeScript is not available
  - Always specify the language in code blocks: ```typescript
  - Format code according to the [Google TypeScript Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/tsguide.html)

- **Quality and Completeness**
  - Ensure code examples are complete and runnable when possible
  - Include imports and dependencies
  - Use realistic variable and function names
  - Include proper error handling
  - Include comments to explain complex logic
  - Show both the happy path and error handling

- **Best Practices**

  - Include monitoring and observability
  - Demonstrate proper security practices
  - Show proper resource cleanup
  - When showing examples for paid services (e.g., Confluent Kafka, Azure, Aidbox, MuleSoft, Apollo GraphOS, Okta), leverage vendor-specific features that reduce operational overhead

- **Example Structure**
  - Start with a brief explanation of what the code does
  - Show the complete code example
  - Explain key parts of the code after the example
  - Include expected output or behavior where appropriate

### Diagrams

All documentation that describes architecture, workflows, or complex concepts **must** include diagrams that follow these guidelines:

- **Diagram Format**
  - Use mermaid diagrams for all technical diagrams
  - Use the latest stable version of mermaid syntax
  - Include both the rendered diagram and the source code
  - Format mermaid code blocks as ```mermaid

- **Design Principles**
  - Keep diagrams simple and focused on one concept
  - Limit the number of elements to improve readability
  - Use a logical flow (typically left-to-right or top-to-bottom)
  - Group related elements together
  - Use consistent colors and shapes across all diagrams

- **Visual Standards**
  - Use the following color scheme:
    - Core components: #00426A (navy)
    - External systems: #E70665 (magenta)
    - Data stores: #FF8F1D (yellow)
    - Security elements: #1E91D6 (blue)
  - Use consistent shapes:
    - Rectangles for services and components
    - Cylinders for databases
    - Hexagons for external systems
    - Diamonds for decision points

- **Annotations and Labels**
  - Include clear, concise labels for all elements
  - Add brief descriptions for complex interactions
  - Include a legend when using multiple types of elements
  - Add a title that describes the diagram's purpose

- **Example Mermaid Diagram**

```

## Implementation and Compliance

### Documentation Review Process

All documentation changes must go through a formal review process to ensure compliance with these standards:

1. **Self-Review Checklist**
   - Before submitting documentation, authors must complete a self-review using the [Documentation Standards Checklist](../templates/documentation-checklist.md)
   - The checklist must be included in the pull request description

2. **Peer Review**
   - All documentation changes require at least one review from a peer
   - Reviewers must verify compliance with these standards
   - Reviewers should use the Documentation Standards Checklist as a guide

3. **Technical Accuracy Review**
   - Documentation for technical components requires a review from a subject matter expert
   - The technical reviewer must verify the accuracy of all technical content
   - Code examples must be validated for correctness and adherence to best practices

4. **Final Approval**
   - Documentation changes require final approval from a documentation maintainer
   - Maintainers are responsible for ensuring consistency across all documentation

### Tools and Automation

The following tools and automation are in place to help maintain documentation standards:

1. **Markdown Linting**
   - All markdown files are automatically linted using markdownlint
   - Configuration is in the `.markdownlint.json` file in the repository root
   - Pull requests will fail CI checks if linting errors are present

2. **Documentation Structure Validation**
   - Automated checks verify the required folder structure and files
   - Pull requests will fail CI checks if required files are missing

3. **Link Validation**
   - Automated checks verify that all internal links are valid
   - Broken links must be fixed before merging

4. **Template Generator**
   - Use the template generator script to create new documentation files:
   - `node scripts/create-doc-template.js <component-name> <doc-type> <file-name>`
   - Example: `node scripts/create-doc-template.js fhir-interoperability-platform 01-getting-started overview.md`

### Handling Exceptions

In rare cases, exceptions to these standards may be necessary. The process for handling exceptions is:

1. **Exception Request**
   - Submit an exception request to the architecture team
   - Include a detailed justification for the exception
   - Specify which standards cannot be met and why

2. **Review and Approval**
   - The architecture team will review the exception request
   - Exceptions require approval from at least two architecture team members
   - Approved exceptions will be documented in the implementation tracking document

3. **Documentation**
   - All approved exceptions must be documented in the affected files
   - Include a comment at the top of the file explaining the exception
   - Reference the exception approval in the pull request

### Measuring Compliance

Compliance with documentation standards is measured and tracked:

1. **Documentation Coverage Report**
   - A weekly report shows documentation coverage for each component
   - Coverage is measured as a percentage of required documents that exist
   - The report is available in the documentation dashboard

2. **Quality Metrics**
   - Documentation quality is measured using automated tools
   - Metrics include readability scores, broken links, and linting errors
   - Quality scores are included in the documentation dashboard

3. **Implementation Tracking**
   - The [Implementation Tracking](implementation-tracking.md) document tracks progress toward full compliance
   - Each component is assessed for compliance with these standards
   - The tracking document is updated monthly

### Documentation Guidelines

When documenting components that implement or interact with these cross-cutting concerns:

1. **Reference, Don't Duplicate**
   - Briefly mention the pattern or concern as it relates to the component
   - Include a reference to the detailed documentation in the reference architecture
   - Focus on component-specific implementation details only

2. **Use Consistent Terminology**
   - Use the same terminology as defined in the reference architecture
   - Maintain consistency in diagrams and visual representations
   - Ensure component-specific documentation aligns with system-wide patterns

3. **Clarify Component Boundaries**
   - Clearly delineate where component responsibility ends and system-wide patterns begin
   - Explain how the component participates in the larger pattern
   - Document component-specific configuration related to the pattern

### Example Documentation Approach

**In Component Documentation:**

```markdown
## Event-Driven Integration

The API Marketplace publishes the following events to the Event Broker:

| Event | Topic | Purpose | Payload Schema |
|-------|-------|---------|----------------|
| ApiRegistered | api.lifecycle | Notify when a new API is registered | [ApiRegisteredEvent](#) |
| ApiDeprecated | api.lifecycle | Notify when an API is deprecated | [ApiDeprecatedEvent](#) |

For details on the event-driven architecture patterns, event schema standards, and cross-component choreography, see the [Event-Driven Architecture Reference](../../reference_architecture/event-driven-architecture.md).
```

**In Reference Architecture Documentation:**

```markdown
## Event-Driven Architecture

The CMM Technology Platform uses an event-driven architecture for asynchronous communication between components. This enables loose coupling, real-time updates, scalability, and resilience.

### Event Flow

[System-wide event flow diagram]

### Event Schema Standards

[Standard event envelope structure, versioning, etc.]

### Component Responsibilities

| Component | Producer Role | Consumer Role |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| API Marketplace | Publishes API lifecycle events | Consumes usage events |
| Event Broker | Manages topics and subscriptions | N/A |
| FHIR Platform | Publishes resource change events | Consumes integration events |
```
