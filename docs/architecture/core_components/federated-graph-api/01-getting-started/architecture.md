# Federated Graph API Architecture

## Overview

The Federated Graph API architecture provides a unified GraphQL interface that aggregates data from multiple sources while maintaining domain separation and independent scalability. This document outlines the architectural components, design principles, and implementation patterns of the Federated Graph API within the CMM Technology Platform.

## Core Components

### 1. Apollo Federation Gateway

The Apollo Federation Gateway serves as the entry point for all GraphQL queries, managing the composition of schemas from multiple subgraphs and routing query portions to the appropriate services.

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Schema composition and validation
- Query planning and execution
- Request authentication and authorization
- Error handling and response formatting
- Performance monitoring and tracing

**Implementation:**
- Built with TypeScript and Apollo Server
- Containerized for cloud-native deployment
- Horizontally scalable for high availability

### 2. Subgraphs

Subgraphs are domain-specific GraphQL services that implement portions of the overall schema. Each subgraph is independently developed, deployed, and scaled.

**Key Subgraphs:**
- **Patients Subgraph**: Manages patient demographics and contact information
- **Encounters Subgraph**: Handles clinical encounters and visits
- **Medications Subgraph**: Manages medication orders and prescriptions
- **Claims Subgraph**: Processes insurance claims and billing information
- **Providers Subgraph**: Manages healthcare provider information

**Implementation:**
- TypeScript-based GraphQL services
- Domain-driven design principles
- Independent CI/CD pipelines
- Containerized for deployment flexibility

### 3. Schema Registry

The Schema Registry maintains the canonical version of the federated schema and validates schema changes for compatibility.

**Key Features:**
- Schema versioning and change tracking
- Compatibility validation
- Schema documentation
- Developer tooling integration

## Communication Patterns

### 1. Query Resolution Flow

1. Client submits a GraphQL query to the Federation Gateway
2. Gateway authenticates the request and validates permissions
3. Query planner breaks the query into subgraph-specific operations
4. Gateway dispatches operations to relevant subgraphs in parallel
5. Subgraphs execute their portions and return results
6. Gateway assembles the complete response and returns it to the client

### 2. Entity References

Entities can be referenced across subgraphs using the `@key` directive, enabling a cohesive data graph despite distributed ownership:

```graphql
# In Patients Subgraph
type Patient @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  dateOfBirth: String!
}

# In Encounters Subgraph
type Encounter {
  id: ID!
  patient: Patient!
  date: String!
  type: String!
}

type Patient @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  encounters: [Encounter!]!
}
```

## Deployment Architecture

### Kubernetes Deployment

The Federated Graph API is deployed on Kubernetes for scalability and resilience:

- Gateway deployed as a StatefulSet with multiple replicas
- Subgraphs deployed as independent Deployments
- Horizontal Pod Autoscaling based on CPU/memory usage
- Service mesh for secure service-to-service communication
- Ingress controller for external access

### Multi-Region Deployment

For high availability and data residency requirements, the architecture supports multi-region deployment:

- Gateway deployed in each region with global load balancing
- Subgraphs deployed in regions based on data residency requirements
- Cross-region service discovery for transparent operation
- Region-aware routing for data sovereignty compliance

## Security Architecture

### Authentication and Authorization

- OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect integration for authentication
- JWT validation at the gateway level
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for coarse-grained permissions
- Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) for fine-grained data access
- Field-level security using GraphQL directives

### Data Protection

- TLS encryption for all communications
- Data masking for sensitive healthcare information
- Audit logging for compliance requirements
- Rate limiting and query complexity analysis for DoS protection

## Observability

### Monitoring and Metrics

- Prometheus integration for metrics collection
- Grafana dashboards for visualization
- Custom GraphQL-specific metrics:
  - Query latency by operation
  - Error rates by subgraph
  - Query complexity distribution

### Distributed Tracing

- OpenTelemetry integration for distributed tracing
- Trace context propagation across subgraphs
- Jaeger or Zipkin for trace visualization

## Performance Considerations

### Caching Strategy

- Response caching at the gateway level
- Apollo Cache Control integration
- Redis-based distributed caching
- Cache invalidation through event-driven patterns

### Query Optimization

- DataLoader pattern for batching and caching
- Query complexity analysis
- Automatic persisted queries (APQ)
- Query whitelisting for production environments

## Development Workflow

### Schema Development

1. Subgraph teams develop and test their schemas independently
2. Schema changes are validated against the federated schema
3. CI/CD pipeline runs compatibility checks
4. Changes are deployed to staging for integration testing
5. Production deployment with schema versioning

### Schema Governance

- Schema review process for breaking changes
- Deprecation strategy for evolving schemas
- Schema documentation requirements
- Naming conventions and standards enforcement

## Integration Points

### Event Broker Integration

The Federated Graph API integrates with the Event Broker for event-driven patterns:

- Subscription resolvers use Event Broker for real-time updates
- Cache invalidation triggered by relevant events
- Event publication from mutation resolvers

### FHIR Integration

Integration with FHIR resources is handled through dedicated subgraphs:

- FHIR Resource mapping to GraphQL types
- FHIR search parameter translation
- FHIR version compatibility management

## Conclusion

The Federated Graph API architecture provides a scalable, maintainable, and secure approach to building a unified API layer for healthcare applications. By leveraging Apollo Federation, TypeScript, and cloud-native deployment patterns, the architecture enables domain-specific teams to work independently while providing a cohesive API experience for client applications.
