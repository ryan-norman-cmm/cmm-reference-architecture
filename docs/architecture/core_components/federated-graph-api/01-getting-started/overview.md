# Federated Graph API Documentation Artifacts

## Introduction

The Federated Graph API is a core component of the healthcare modernization architecture, providing a unified GraphQL interface that aggregates data from multiple sources, including FHIR servers, legacy systems, and third-party services. This document outlines the comprehensive set of documentation artifacts that support the implementation, configuration, and optimization of the Federated Graph API.

A federated GraphQL architecture allows you to divide your graph into separate, domain-specific subgraphs that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. This approach is particularly valuable in healthcare environments where data exists in multiple systems and formats but needs to be presented through a unified, consistent API.

### Quick Start

1. Begin with the [Federated Graph API Setup Guide](setup-guide.md) to configure your environment
2. Set up secure access with [API Authentication](../02-core-functionality/authentication.md)
3. Learn how to [Create Your First Subgraph](../02-core-functionality/creating-subgraphs.md)
4. Explore [Querying the Federated Graph](../02-core-functionality/querying.md) for data retrieval patterns
5. Optimize performance with [Query Optimization](../03-advanced-patterns/query-optimization.md) techniques
