# Performance Tuning

## Introduction

Performance tuning is essential for maintaining a responsive, efficient Federated Graph API. This guide explains strategies for optimizing performance across your GraphQL infrastructure, covering query execution optimization, caching strategies, database query optimization, and network optimization. By implementing these performance tuning techniques, you can ensure your API remains fast and responsive even as it scales to handle complex healthcare data queries.

## Performance Analytics with Apollo GraphOS

Apollo GraphOS provides deep performance analytics for federated GraphQL APIs, enabling you to:
- Monitor query latency and resolver timings across gateway and subgraphs
- Identify slow or expensive queries using field-level analytics
- Detect and troubleshoot N+1 query patterns and bottlenecks
- Track performance trends over time and correlate with deployments

### Example: Using GraphOS for Performance Tuning
- Enable GraphOS monitoring as shown in the Monitoring documentation.
- Use the GraphOS Explorer and Metrics dashboards to:
  - View slowest queries and top error sources
  - Analyze resolver timings for each field and operation
  - Drill down into subgraph-specific performance issues
- Set up alerts for queries that exceed latency thresholds or have high error rates.

### Best Practices
- Regularly review GraphOS performance dashboards to proactively identify issues.
- Use field-level analytics to optimize resolver implementations and batching.
- Collaborate across teams to resolve cross-subgraph performance bottlenecks.
- Leverage GraphOSâ€™s historical analytics to validate the impact of optimizations.

## Query Execution Optimization

*This section will cover techniques for optimizing query execution in a federated GraphQL architecture, including query planning, batching, and parallelization.*

## Caching Strategies

*This section will explain different caching approaches at various levels of the stack, including HTTP caching, CDN caching, application-level caching, and database caching.*

```typescript
// Example: Implementing response caching in Apollo Server
const { ApolloServer } = require('apollo-server');
const { ApolloGateway } = require('@apollo/gateway');
const responseCachePlugin = require('apollo-server-plugin-response-cache');

// Initialize the gateway
const gateway = new ApolloGateway({
  serviceList: [
    // Your services here
  ],
});

// Initialize the Apollo Server with caching
const server = new ApolloServer({
  gateway,
  subscriptions: false,
  plugins: [responseCachePlugin({
    // Cache responses for up to 30 seconds
    defaultMaxAge: 30,
    // Don't cache errors
    shouldReadFromCache: requestContext => !requestContext.errors,
    // Only cache GET requests
    shouldWriteToCache: requestContext => requestContext.request.operationName !== 'IntrospectionQuery',
    // Extract cache key from context
    extraCacheKeyData: requestContext => {
      // Include user ID in cache key to prevent data leakage between users
      const user = requestContext.context.user;
      return user ? { userId: user.id } : {};
    }
  })],
  // Enable cache control directives in the schema
  cacheControl: {
    defaultMaxAge: 5,
    calculateHttpHeaders: true
  }
});

server.listen().then(({ url }) => {
  console.log(`ud83dude80 Gateway ready at ${url}`);
});
```

## Database Query Optimization

*This section will cover techniques for optimizing database queries, including indexing, query rewriting, and database-specific optimizations.*

## Network Optimization

*This section will explain strategies for optimizing network performance, including connection pooling, keep-alive settings, and compression.*

## Load Testing and Benchmarking

*This section will cover approaches to load testing and benchmarking your Federated Graph API to identify performance bottlenecks and validate improvements.*

```bash
# Example: Using k6 for load testing a GraphQL API
# Save this as load-test.js

import http from 'k6/http';
import { check, sleep } from 'k6';

// Define the GraphQL query
const query = `
query GetPatients {
  patients(first: 10) {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        name {
          given
          family
        }
        birthDate
      }
    }
  }
}
`;

// Test configuration
export const options = {
  stages: [
    { duration: '30s', target: 20 }, // Ramp up to 20 users over 30 seconds
    { duration: '1m', target: 20 },  // Stay at 20 users for 1 minute
    { duration: '30s', target: 0 },  // Ramp down to 0 users over 30 seconds
  ],
  thresholds: {
    http_req_duration: ['p(95)<500'], // 95% of requests should complete within 500ms
    http_req_failed: ['rate<0.01'],    // Less than 1% of requests should fail
  },
};

// Main function
export default function () {
  const url = 'http://localhost:4000/graphql';
  const payload = JSON.stringify({
    query: query,
    variables: {}
  });
  
  const params = {
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'Authorization': 'Bearer test-token' // Add auth if needed
    },
  };
  
  // Make the request
  const res = http.post(url, payload, params);
  
  // Check that the response was successful
  check(res, {
    'status is 200': (r) => r.status === 200,
    'no errors': (r) => {
      const body = JSON.parse(r.body);
      return !body.errors;
    },
    'has data': (r) => {
      const body = JSON.parse(r.body);
      return body.data && body.data.patients;
    },
  });
  
  // Wait between requests
  sleep(1);
}

# Run with: k6 run load-test.js
```
