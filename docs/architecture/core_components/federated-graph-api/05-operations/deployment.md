# Deployment Automation

## Introduction

Automating the deployment of your Federated Graph API is essential for maintaining reliability and enabling rapid iteration. This guide explains how to implement deployment automation for your GraphQL infrastructure, covering CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure as code, environment management, and automated testing. By implementing these automation practices, you can ensure consistent, reliable deployments while minimizing manual effort and human error.

## Deployment Validation with Apollo GraphOS

Apollo GraphOS ensures safe and reliable deployments for federated GraphQL APIs by providing:
- Automated schema validation and composition checks before deployment
- Operation safelisting to prevent unauthorized or costly queries
- CI/CD integration for deployment gating and rollback
- Deployment history and audit logs for compliance

### Example: CI/CD Deployment Validation with GraphOS
- Add a schema check step to your deployment workflow using the Rover CLI:

```yaml
name: GraphOS Deployment Check
on: [push]
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install Rover
        run: npm install -g @apollo/rover
      - name: Validate Schema
        run: |
          rover subgraph check my-graph@current \
            --name patient-subgraph \
            --schema ./schema.graphql
      - name: Deploy if Valid
        run: |
          # Add your deployment script here
```

- Use GraphOS to review deployment history, rollback changes, and audit all schema modifications.
- Safelist approved operations in GraphOS to restrict what can be executed in production.

### Best Practices
- Block deployments if schema validation fails or breaking changes are detected.
- Require review and approval of schema changes in GraphOS before merging.
- Maintain deployment and schema change logs for compliance and troubleshooting.
- Reference the official docs for advanced deployment validation: [Apollo GraphOS Deployment](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/)

### Quick Start

1. Set up a CI/CD pipeline for your gateway and subgraphs
2. Implement infrastructure as code for your GraphQL resources
3. Create a strategy for managing different environments
4. Configure automated testing for your deployments
5. Implement schema validation as part of your deployment process

## CI/CD Pipelines

*This section will cover how to set up CI/CD pipelines for your gateway and subgraphs, including build, test, and deployment stages.*

```yaml
# Example: GitHub Actions workflow for a subgraph
name: Deploy Subgraph

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
    paths:
      - 'subgraphs/patient-subgraph/**'

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '16'
          
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          cd subgraphs/patient-subgraph
          npm ci
          
      - name: Run tests
        run: |
          cd subgraphs/patient-subgraph
          npm test
          
      - name: Build
        run: |
          cd subgraphs/patient-subgraph
          npm run build
          
      - name: Validate schema
        run: |
          cd subgraphs/patient-subgraph
          npx rover subgraph check healthcare-federation@prod \
            --name patient-subgraph \
            --schema ./dist/schema.graphql
          
      - name: Publish schema
        if: success()
        run: |
          cd subgraphs/patient-subgraph
          npx rover subgraph publish healthcare-federation@prod \
            --name patient-subgraph \
            --schema ./dist/schema.graphql
          
      - name: Deploy to Kubernetes
        if: success()
        run: |
          cd subgraphs/patient-subgraph
          kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml
```

## Infrastructure as Code

*This section will explain how to use infrastructure as code tools like Terraform, CloudFormation, or Pulumi to manage your GraphQL infrastructure.*

## Environment Management

*This section will cover strategies for managing different environments (development, staging, production) for your Federated Graph API.*

## Automated Testing

*This section will explain how to implement automated testing for your GraphQL API, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.*

```typescript
// Example: Integration test for a GraphQL API using Jest and Supertest
const request = require('supertest');
const { createTestClient } = require('apollo-server-testing');
const { ApolloServer } = require('apollo-server');
const { buildFederatedSchema } = require('@apollo/federation');

const typeDefs = require('./schema');
const resolvers = require('./resolvers');

describe('Patient Subgraph', () => {
  let server;
  let query;
  
  beforeAll(() => {
    // Create a test server
    server = new ApolloServer({
      schema: buildFederatedSchema([{ typeDefs, resolvers }]),
      context: () => ({
        // Mock context for testing
        dataSources: {
          patientAPI: {
            getPatientById: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue({
              id: '123',
              name: [{ given: ['John'], family: 'Doe' }],
              birthDate: '1970-01-01',
              gender: 'male'
            }),
            searchPatients: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue([
              {
                id: '123',
                name: [{ given: ['John'], family: 'Doe' }],
                birthDate: '1970-01-01',
                gender: 'male'
              },
              {
                id: '456',
                name: [{ given: ['Jane'], family: 'Smith' }],
                birthDate: '1980-02-02',
                gender: 'female'
              }
            ])
          }
        }
      })
    });
    
    // Create a test client
    const testClient = createTestClient(server);
    query = testClient.query;
  });
  
  it('should return a patient by ID', async () => {
    const GET_PATIENT = `
      query GetPatient($id: ID!) {
        patient(id: $id) {
          id
          name {
            given
            family
          }
          birthDate
          gender
        }
      }
    `;
    
    const result = await query({ query: GET_PATIENT, variables: { id: '123' } });
    
    expect(result.errors).toBeUndefined();
    expect(result.data.patient).toEqual({
      id: '123',
      name: [{ given: ['John'], family: 'Doe' }],
      birthDate: '1970-01-01',
      gender: 'male'
    });
  });
  
  it('should search for patients', async () => {
    const SEARCH_PATIENTS = `
      query SearchPatients($name: String) {
        searchPatients(name: $name) {
          id
          name {
            given
            family
          }
          birthDate
          gender
        }
      }
    `;
    
    const result = await query({ query: SEARCH_PATIENTS, variables: { name: 'Doe' } });
    
    expect(result.errors).toBeUndefined();
    expect(result.data.searchPatients).toHaveLength(2);
    expect(result.data.searchPatients[0].id).toBe('123');
    expect(result.data.searchPatients[1].id).toBe('456');
  });
});
```
