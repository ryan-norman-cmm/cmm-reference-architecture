# Event Broker Setup Guide

## Introduction

This guide walks you through the process of setting up the Event Broker for the CMM Reference Architecture. It covers the installation and configuration of Confluent Kafka, the implementation of healthcare-specific event schemas, and the integration with other core components. By following these steps, you'll establish a robust foundation for event-driven healthcare applications that enable real-time data exchange and workflow automation.

The setup process is organized into logical sections that progress from basic infrastructure setup to advanced configuration. Each section builds upon the previous ones, allowing for incremental implementation and testing. While this guide provides a comprehensive approach, you can adapt it to your specific environment and requirements.

## Prerequisites

Before beginning the Event Broker setup process, ensure you have:

### Hardware Requirements

- **Development Environment**:
  - Minimum: 3 servers (16GB RAM, 4 vCPUs, 100GB SSD each)
  - Recommended: 5 servers (32GB RAM, 8 vCPUs, 250GB SSD each)

- **Production Environment**:
  - Minimum: 5 servers (32GB RAM, 8 vCPUs, 500GB SSD each)
  - Recommended: 9+ servers (64GB RAM, 16 vCPUs, 1TB SSD each)
  - Network: 10 Gbps between broker nodes

### Software Requirements

- **Operating System**: Linux (RHEL 8+, Ubuntu 20.04+, or similar)
- **Java**: OpenJDK 11 or later
- **Confluent Platform**: Version 7.0 or later
- **Docker**: Version 20.10 or later (for containerized deployment)
- **Kubernetes**: Version 1.21 or later (for cloud-native deployment)

### Network Requirements

- Dedicated subnet for Kafka cluster communication
- Open ports for Kafka (9092), ZooKeeper (2181), Schema Registry (8081)
- Network security groups configured for cluster communication
- Load balancer for client connectivity (optional but recommended)

### Security Prerequisites

- TLS certificates for encrypted communication
- Authentication credentials (LDAP, Kerberos, or mTLS)
- Access to security policies and compliance requirements
- Data classification guidelines for healthcare information

### Knowledge Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of event-driven architecture
- Familiarity with Linux system administration
- Knowledge of healthcare data formats (FHIR, HL7)
- Understanding of security and compliance requirements in healthcare
