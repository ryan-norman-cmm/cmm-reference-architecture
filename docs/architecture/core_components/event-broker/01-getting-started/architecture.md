# Event Broker Architecture

## Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Event Broker architecture within the CMM Technology Platform. The Event Broker, implemented using Confluent Kafka, serves as the central nervous system for real-time data exchange and event-driven communication across the healthcare ecosystem. This architecture enables high-throughput, fault-tolerant, real-time event processing that meets the demanding requirements of healthcare environments.

## Architectural Principles

The Event Broker architecture is guided by the following principles:

1. **Decoupling**: Minimize direct dependencies between systems
2. **Resilience**: Ensure fault tolerance and high availability
3. **Scalability**: Support horizontal scaling for growing workloads
4. **Security**: Protect sensitive healthcare data throughout its lifecycle
5. **Observability**: Provide comprehensive monitoring and visibility
6. **Compliance**: Adhere to healthcare regulatory requirements
