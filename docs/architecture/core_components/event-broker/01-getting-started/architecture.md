# Event Broker Architecture

## Introduction
This document outlines the architectural design of the Event Broker core component, providing insights into its structure, data flows, and integration patterns. The Event Broker is built on Confluent Kafka to provide reliable, scalable, and secure event streaming for healthcare workflows.

## Architectural Overview
The Event Broker serves as the central nervous system of the CoverMyMeds Technology Platform, facilitating asynchronous, event-driven communication between components and external systems. It implements a distributed streaming platform that enables real-time data processing while maintaining high throughput, fault tolerance, and horizontal scalability.

The architecture follows a publish-subscribe model with strict schema governance, ensuring that events are standardized, validated, and reliably delivered across the healthcare ecosystem.

## Component Structure

### Core Infrastructure Layer
- **Kafka Brokers**: Distributed nodes that store and process event streams
- **ZooKeeper Ensemble**: Coordination service that manages broker cluster state
- **Schema Registry**: Centralized schema storage and compatibility enforcement
- **Connect Cluster**: Framework for integrating Kafka with external systems
- **ksqlDB**: Stream processing engine for real-time analytics and transformations

### Management & Monitoring Layer
- **Confluent Control Center**: Administrative interface for the Kafka ecosystem
- **Metrics Aggregation**: Collects performance and utilization metrics
- **Alerting System**: Notifies operators of critical conditions
- **Audit Logging**: Records administrative and operational events

### Security Layer
- **Authentication**: Multi-protocol identity verification (SASL, mTLS)
- **Authorization**: Fine-grained access control for topics and operations
- **Encryption**: Data protection in transit and at rest
- **Audit**: Comprehensive tracking of security-relevant actions

### Integration Layer
- **Connectors**: Pre-built integrations with databases and systems
- **REST Proxy**: HTTP interface for Kafka operations
- **SDK Adapters**: Client libraries for various programming languages
- **Event Gateways**: Specialized interfaces for healthcare systems

## Data Flow

1. **Event Publication Flow**:
   - Producer application generates an event
   - Event is validated against the schema registry
   - Producer client batches and compresses events
   - Events are transmitted to the appropriate topic partition
   - Broker acknowledges receipt based on configured guarantees

2. **Event Consumption Flow**:
   - Consumer subscribes to relevant topics
   - Consumer pulls batches of events from assigned partitions
   - Events are processed by the consumer application
   - Consumer commits offsets to track progress
   - Consumer group rebalances when members join or leave

3. **Event Processing Flow**:
   - ksqlDB processes event streams in real-time
   - Stream processors apply transformations and enrichments
   - Derived events are published to new topics
   - Materialized views provide queryable snapshots of stream state

4. **Data Integration Flow**:
   - Source connectors import data from external systems
   - Event translation and normalization occurs
   - Sink connectors export events to external systems
   - Bidirectional synchronization maintains consistency

## Design Patterns

- **Event Sourcing**: Using the event log as the authoritative source of truth
- **CQRS**: Separating read and write operations for performance and scalability
- **Saga Pattern**: Coordinating distributed transactions through events
- **Event Collaboration**: Services working together through event chains
- **Materialized Views**: Pre-computed views derived from event streams
- **Event Replay**: Reconstructing state by replaying historical events
- **Dead Letter Queue**: Handling invalid or unprocessable events
