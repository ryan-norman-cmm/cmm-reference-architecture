# Event Broker

## Introduction

The Event Broker is a foundational component of the CMM Technology Platform, serving as the central nervous system for real-time data exchange and event-driven communication. Our implementation uses Confluent Kafka, a distributed streaming platform that enables high-throughput, fault-tolerant, real-time event processing across the healthcare ecosystem. This document provides an overview of the Event Broker's architecture, key concepts, and implementation considerations for healthcare environments.

## Key Concepts

### Event-Driven Architecture

Event-driven architecture (EDA) is a software design pattern where the production, detection, consumption, and reaction to events drive the system's behavior. In the context of healthcare:

- **Events**: Discrete changes in state or notifications (e.g., patient admission, medication order, insurance verification)
- **Publishers**: Systems that generate events (e.g., EHR systems, patient portals, pharmacy systems)
- **Subscribers**: Systems that consume and react to events (e.g., analytics platforms, workflow engines, notification services)
- **Event Broker**: The intermediary that manages event delivery between publishers and subscribers

This decoupled approach enables systems to evolve independently while maintaining real-time data flow and process integration.

### Why Confluent Kafka?

Confluent Kafka was selected as our Event Broker for several key reasons:

- **Scalability**: Handles millions of events per second with horizontal scaling
- **Reliability**: Provides fault tolerance and high availability for mission-critical healthcare data
- **Data Retention**: Supports configurable retention policies for compliance requirements
- **Ecosystem**: Offers a rich set of connectors, stream processing capabilities, and management tools
- **Schema Registry**: Enforces data structure consistency and evolution
- **Security**: Provides comprehensive authentication, authorization, and encryption

- **Persistent Storage**: Durable storage of events with configurable retention
- **Low Latency**: Millisecond-level delivery for real-time healthcare processes
- **Backpressure Handling**: Graceful handling of traffic spikes

#### Fault Tolerance and Reliability

Robust mechanisms ensure no data loss even during system failures:

- **Replication**: Configurable replication factor for data redundancy
- **Leader Election**: Automatic failover for broker failures
- **Exactly-Once Semantics**: Prevention of duplicate event processing
- **Offset Management**: Tracking of consumer progress for recovery
- **Cluster Balancing**: Automatic workload distribution

### Data Governance

#### Schema Management

The Schema Registry ensures data quality and compatibility:

- **Schema Enforcement**: Validation of event structure against defined schemas
- **Schema Evolution**: Controlled changes to event structures over time
