# Event Broker Key Concepts

## Introduction

This document outlines the fundamental concepts and terminology of the Event Broker component in the CMM Technology Platform. Understanding these key concepts is essential for effectively designing, implementing, and operating event-driven healthcare solutions. The Event Broker, built on Confluent Kafka, provides the foundation for real-time data exchange and event-driven architecture across the healthcare ecosystem.

## Core Concepts

### Events

Events are the fundamental unit of data in the Event Broker system:

- **Definition**: An event is a record of something that has happenedâ€”a fact or state change that occurred at a specific point in time
- **Structure**: Events typically contain a key, value, timestamp, and optional headers
- **Immutability**: Events are immutable records of what happened and cannot be changed once produced
- **Examples**: Patient admission, medication order, lab result, insurance verification, appointment scheduling

### Event Streams

Event streams represent a continuous flow of related events:

- **Definition**: An ordered, replayable, and fault-tolerant sequence of events
- **Persistence**: Events are stored durably for a configured retention period
- **Append-Only**: New events are always added to the end of the stream
- **Replayability**: Consumers can replay events from any point in the stream
- **Examples**: Patient admission stream, medication order stream, lab result stream

### Topics

Topics are the organizational units for event streams in Kafka:

- **Definition**: A named feed or category of events
- **Partitioning**: Topics are divided into partitions for parallelism
- **Ordering**: Events within a partition are strictly ordered
- **Retention**: Topics have configurable retention policies
- **Naming Convention**: `<domain>.<entity>.<event-type>` (e.g., `clinical.patient.admitted`)

### Partitions

Partitions enable parallel processing of events within a topic:

- **Definition**: An ordered, immutable sequence of events that belongs to a topic
- **Scaling**: Multiple partitions allow horizontal scaling of processing
- **Assignment**: Each partition is assigned to one consumer per consumer group
- **Ordering**: Events with the same key are guaranteed to go to the same partition
- **Sizing**: Partition count should be based on throughput and parallelism requirements

### Producers

Producers are applications or systems that publish events to topics:

- **Function**: Create and send events to one or more topics
- **Acknowledgments**: Can receive confirmation of successful event delivery
- **Batching**: Can batch events for efficiency
- **Partitioning**: Can control which partition receives an event via the event key
- **Examples**: EHR systems, medical devices, patient portals, pharmacy systems

### Consumers

Consumers are applications or systems that subscribe to and process events from topics:

- **Function**: Read and process events from one or more topics
- **Offsets**: Track their position (offset) in each partition
- **Consumer Groups**: Coordinate consumption across multiple instances
- **Scaling**: Multiple consumers in a group process different partitions in parallel
- **Examples**: Analytics platforms, notification services, workflow engines, data lakes

### Consumer Groups

Consumer groups enable parallel processing and fault tolerance:

- **Definition**: A set of consumers that cooperate to consume events from topics
- **Partition Assignment**: Each partition is assigned to exactly one consumer in the group
- **Rebalancing**: If consumers are added or removed, partitions are reassigned
- **Offset Management**: The group tracks the consumption progress for each partition
- **Use Cases**: Scaling event processing, providing fault tolerance

### Offsets

Offsets track the position of consumers within partitions:

- **Definition**: A sequential ID assigned to events within a partition
- **Consumption Tracking**: Consumers use offsets to track their progress
- **Commit**: Consumers periodically commit their offsets to the broker
- **Reset Policies**: Configurable behavior for new consumers (earliest, latest)
- **Retention**: Offsets are retained even after events are deleted

## Advanced Concepts

### Schema Registry

The Schema Registry manages and enforces event schemas:

- **Function**: Central repository for event schemas
- **Compatibility**: Enforces schema evolution rules
- **Formats**: Supports AVRO, JSON Schema, and Protocol Buffers
- **Versioning**: Tracks schema versions and evolution
- **Validation**: Ensures events conform to registered schemas

### Connect Framework

Kafka Connect provides standardized integration with external systems:

- **Connectors**: Pre-built components for common systems
- **Source Connectors**: Import data from external systems into Kafka
- **Sink Connectors**: Export data from Kafka to external systems
- **Transformations**: Modify data during import or export
- **Distributed Mode**: Scalable deployment across multiple workers

### Stream Processing

Stream processing enables real-time data transformation and analysis:

- **Kafka Streams**: Java library for stream processing
- **ksqlDB**: SQL-like language for stream processing
- **Stateless Operations**: Filtering, mapping, flatMapping
- **Stateful Operations**: Aggregations, joins, windowing
- **Exactly-Once Semantics**: Guaranteed processing semantics

### Exactly-Once Semantics

Exactly-once semantics ensure reliable event processing:

- **Definition**: Each event is processed exactly once, even in the face of failures
- **Transactions**: Kafka's transactional API ensures atomic operations
- **Idempotent Producers**: Prevent duplicate events due to retries
- **Consumer Offsets**: Committed atomically with processing results
- **Use Cases**: Critical for financial and clinical event processing

## Healthcare-Specific Concepts

### Clinical Event Domains

Clinical event domains organize healthcare events by functional area:

- **Patient Events**: Admissions, discharges, transfers, demographics
- **Clinical Events**: Observations, diagnoses, procedures, allergies
- **Medication Events**: Orders, dispensing, administration
- **Laboratory Events**: Orders, results, critical values
- **Imaging Events**: Orders, studies, results

### Healthcare Event Schemas

Healthcare event schemas define the structure of healthcare events:

- **FHIR-Aligned**: Schemas aligned with FHIR resource definitions
- **HL7 v2 Mapping**: Transformation from traditional HL7 messages
- **Clinical Coding**: Support for standard clinical terminologies (SNOMED, LOINC, RxNorm)
- **PHI Handling**: Appropriate handling of protected health information
- **Extensibility**: Support for organization-specific extensions

### Event-Driven Clinical Workflows

Event-driven clinical workflows coordinate healthcare processes:

- **Care Pathways**: Sequence of clinical activities for specific conditions
- **Clinical Protocols**: Standardized approaches to clinical situations
- **Alert Systems**: Notification of critical conditions or values
- **Care Coordination**: Communication between care team members
- **Clinical Decision Support**: Real-time guidance based on clinical events

### Consent and Privacy

Consent and privacy mechanisms protect patient information:

- **Consent Events**: Capture and distribute patient consent decisions
- **Data Filtering**: Filter events based on consent and authorization
- **De-identification**: Remove or mask protected health information
- **Audit Trails**: Track access to sensitive health information
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Support for HIPAA, GDPR, and other regulations

## Operational Concepts

### Monitoring and Observability

Monitoring and observability ensure system health and performance:

- **Metrics**: Throughput, latency, disk usage, CPU, memory
- **Logging**: Broker logs, client logs, application logs
- **Alerting**: Proactive notification of issues
- **Dashboards**: Visual representation of system health
- **Tracing**: End-to-end tracking of event flow

### Disaster Recovery

Disaster recovery ensures business continuity:

- **Multi-Region Replication**: Replication across geographic regions
- **MirrorMaker**: Tool for cross-cluster replication
- **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: Maximum acceptable data loss
- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: Maximum acceptable downtime
- **Failover Procedures**: Process for switching to backup systems

### Capacity Planning

Capacity planning ensures adequate resources for event processing:

- **Throughput Estimation**: Expected events per second
- **Storage Calculation**: Required disk space based on retention
- **Partition Sizing**: Appropriate partition count for parallelism
- **Resource Allocation**: CPU, memory, network, and disk requirements
- **Growth Projections**: Planning for future expansion
