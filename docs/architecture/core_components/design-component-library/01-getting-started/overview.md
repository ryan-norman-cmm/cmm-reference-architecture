# Design Component Library

## Introduction

The Design Component Library is a comprehensive suite of UI components, design patterns, and development tools that enable consistent, accessible, and high-quality user interfaces across all CMM applications. Our implementation combines several modern frontend technologies including Storybook, Tailwind CSS, React, Radix UI, Material-UI (MUI), Artifactory, and GitHub Actions to create a robust design system that accelerates development while maintaining design consistency and code quality.

## Key Concepts

### What is a Design Component Library?

A Design Component Library (also known as a design system) is a collection of reusable UI components, design patterns, and guidelines that ensure consistency across applications. In healthcare applications, a well-implemented design system is crucial for:

- **UI Consistency**: Maintaining a unified look and feel across all applications
- **Accessibility**: Ensuring all components meet WCAG standards for healthcare applications
- **Development Efficiency**: Accelerating development through reusable components
- **Quality Assurance**: Providing thoroughly tested components that work across devices
- **Design-Development Collaboration**: Creating a shared language between designers and developers

### Technology Stack

Our Design Component Library leverages several key technologies:

- **React**: Component-based JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development
- **Radix UI**: Unstyled, accessible component primitives for building robust UI components
- **Material-UI (MUI)**: Comprehensive React UI framework with pre-built components following Material Design
- **Storybook**: Development environment for UI components with documentation
- **Artifactory**: Repository manager for storing and distributing component packages
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD automation for testing, building, and publishing components

## Key Features

### Component Hierarchy

Our Design Component Library is organized in a hierarchical structure:

- **Design Tokens**: Fundamental design values (colors, spacing, typography, etc.)
- **Foundation Components**:
  - **Radix UI Primitives**: Unstyled, accessible component primitives (dialog, dropdown, etc.)
  - **Material-UI Base**: Adaptable MUI components with our design tokens
- **Core Components**: Basic UI elements (buttons, inputs, typography, etc.)
- **Composite Components**: Combinations of core components (forms, cards, etc.)
- **Healthcare-Specific Components**: Specialized clinical components (patient banner, vital signs, etc.)
- **Patterns**: Common UI patterns (navigation, layouts, etc.)
- **Templates**: Pre-built page structures for common scenarios

### Storybook Integration

Storybook serves as the primary development and documentation environment:

- Interactive component playground
- Comprehensive documentation
- Accessibility testing
- Responsive design testing
- Visual regression testing
- Component state management

### Component Library Organization

Our component library combines Radix UI primitives and Material-UI components with custom healthcare-specific components:

#### Radix UI Integration

Radix UI provides unstyled, accessible component primitives that serve as the foundation for many of our components:

- **Accessibility-First**: Built with ARIA compliance from the ground up
- **Unstyled Components**: Complete styling flexibility with Tailwind CSS
- **Composable Primitives**: Highly adaptable low-level building blocks
- **Stateful Logic**: Robust interaction handling without styling opinions
- **Keyboard Navigation**: First-class keyboard support for all components

#### Material-UI Integration

Material-UI provides comprehensive, well-tested components that we adapt to our healthcare design system:

- **Rich Component Ecosystem**: Extensive library of pre-built components
- **Theming System**: Customized to match our design tokens
- **Advanced Components**: Complex components like data grids and date pickers
- **Responsive Layouts**: Grid and container systems for adaptive interfaces
- **Performance Optimized**: Efficient rendering for complex healthcare UIs

### Tailwind CSS Implementation

Tailwind CSS is configured specifically for healthcare applications:

- Custom color palette aligned with brand guidelines
- Extended spacing and sizing scales for medical interfaces
- Accessibility-focused utility classes
- Custom components for healthcare-specific UI elements
- Responsive design utilities for clinical workflows

### CI/CD with GitHub Actions

Automated workflows for quality and delivery:

- Automated testing (unit, integration, accessibility)
- Visual regression testing
- Documentation generation
- Package versioning
- Publishing to Artifactory

## Integration Points

The Design Component Library integrates with several key components in our architecture:

- **Web Applications**: Providing consistent UI components
- **Mobile Web Interfaces**: Responsive components for mobile experiences
- **Admin Portals**: Specialized components for administrative interfaces
- **Okta Identity Provider**: Authentication and user profile components
- **Federated GraphQL API**: Data fetching patterns and components
