# Access Control and Security Policies

## Introduction

This document outlines the access control mechanisms and security policies for the Workflow Orchestration Engine component of the CMM Technology Platform. Proper access controls are essential to ensure that only authorized users and systems can create, modify, execute, and monitor workflows within healthcare environments.

## Access Control Model

### Role-Based Access Control

The Workflow Orchestration Engine implements a comprehensive role-based access control (RBAC) model that defines permissions based on user roles:

| Role | Description | Permissions |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| Workflow Viewer | Users who can view workflow definitions and executions | - View workflow definitions<br>- View workflow executions<br>- View workflow metrics<br>- Export workflow reports |
| Workflow Operator | Users who can operate existing workflows | - All Viewer permissions<br>- Execute workflows<br>- Pause/resume workflow executions<br>- Retry failed workflow steps<br>- Manage workflow schedules |
| Workflow Designer | Users who can create and modify workflows | - All Operator permissions<br>- Create workflow definitions<br>- Edit workflow definitions<br>- Test workflow definitions<br>- Import/export workflow definitions |
| Workflow Administrator | Users who manage the workflow platform | - All Designer permissions<br>- Manage workflow environments<br>- Configure workflow integrations<br>- Manage workflow security<br>- Define workflow policies |
| System Administrator | Users who manage the system infrastructure | - All Administrator permissions<br>- Manage system configuration<br>- Monitor system health<br>- Manage system security<br>- Perform system upgrades |

### Permission Management

Permissions within the Workflow Orchestration Engine are managed at multiple levels:

1. **Global Permissions**: Apply across the entire workflow platform
2. **Domain Permissions**: Apply within a specific workflow domain (e.g., clinical, administrative, research)
3. **Workflow Permissions**: Apply to specific workflow definitions or instances
4. **Environment Permissions**: Apply to specific environments (dev, test, prod)

```typescript
// Example: Permission definition for workflow management
interface Permission {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  scope: 'global' | 'domain' | 'workflow' | 'environment';
  action: 'create' | 'read' | 'update' | 'delete' | 'execute' | 'manage';
  resource: string;
}

// Example: Role definition with permissions
interface Role {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  permissions: string[]; // Permission IDs
  isSystem: boolean; // System-defined or custom
  createdBy: string;
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
}

// Example: Role assignment to a user
interface RoleAssignment {
  userId: string;
  roleId: string;
  scope: {
    type: 'global' | 'domain' | 'workflow' | 'environment';
    id?: string; // Optional ID for non-global scopes
  };
  assignedBy: string;
  assignedAt: string;
  expiresAt?: string; // Optional expiration
}
```

## Authentication Mechanisms

### User Authentication

The Workflow Orchestration Engine supports multiple authentication methods for users:

1. **Integration with Enterprise IAM**:
   - SAML 2.0 integration with identity providers
   - OpenID Connect (OIDC) support
   - OAuth 2.0 authorization
   - LDAP/Active Directory integration

2. **Multi-Factor Authentication**:
   - Time-based one-time passwords (TOTP)
   - Push notifications to mobile devices
   - Hardware security keys (FIDO2/WebAuthn)
   - SMS or email verification codes (where appropriate)

3. **Context-Aware Authentication**:
   - Risk-based authentication
   - Location-based access controls
   - Device-based authentication policies
   - Time-based access restrictions

### Service Authentication

For service-to-service authentication, the Workflow Orchestration Engine supports:

1. **API Key Authentication**:
   - Scoped API keys with limited permissions
   - Key rotation policies
   - Usage monitoring and throttling
   - Automatic expiration

2. **OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials**:
   - Client ID and secret authentication
   - Token-based authorization
   - Scope-limited access
   - Short-lived access tokens

3. **Mutual TLS Authentication**:
   - Certificate-based authentication
   - Certificate validation
   - Certificate revocation checking
   - Certificate lifecycle management

```typescript
// Example: Service account for workflow integration
interface ServiceAccount {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  authType: 'api_key' | 'oauth_client_credentials' | 'mutual_tls';
  credentials: {
    // For API key
    apiKey?: string;
    // For OAuth client credentials
    clientId?: string;
    clientSecret?: string;
    // For mutual TLS
    certificateThumbprint?: string;
  };
  permissions: string[]; // Permission IDs
  allowedIpRanges?: string[];
  createdBy: string;
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
  lastUsed?: string;
  expiresAt?: string;
  status: 'active' | 'inactive' | 'expired' | 'revoked';
}
```

## Authorization Framework

### Workflow Access Control

The Workflow Orchestration Engine implements fine-grained access control for workflows:

1. **Workflow Definition Access**:
   - Control who can create, view, edit, and delete workflow definitions
   - Version-specific access controls
   - Template access management
   - Import/export permissions

2. **Workflow Execution Access**:
   - Control who can start, stop, pause, and resume workflow executions
   - Execution monitoring permissions
   - Error handling and retry permissions
   - Execution data access controls

3. **Workflow Data Access**:
   - Input data access controls
   - Output data access controls
   - Execution history access
   - Audit log access

### Clinical Context Authorization

For healthcare workflows, additional authorization based on clinical context is implemented:

1. **Patient Context**:
   - Patient-based access controls
   - Care relationship verification
   - Consent-based authorization
   - Break-glass procedures for emergencies

2. **Encounter Context**:
   - Encounter-based access controls
   - Care team membership verification
   - Clinical role verification
   - Department/location-based controls

3. **Organization Context**:
   - Organization-based access controls
   - Multi-tenancy support
   - Data segregation by organization
   - Cross-organization workflow controls

```typescript
// Example: Clinical context authorization for workflow execution
interface ClinicalContextAuthorization {
  workflowId: string;
  executionId: string;
  contextType: 'patient' | 'encounter' | 'organization';
  contextId: string; // Patient ID, Encounter ID, or Organization ID
  requiredRelationship: 'treating_provider' | 'care_team' | 'organization_member' | 'any';
  breakGlassAllowed: boolean;
  accessRestrictions?: {
    dataElements?: string[];
    operations?: string[];
    timeRestrictions?: {
      allowedTimeRanges?: string[];
      expiresAt?: string;
    };
  };
}

// Example: Break-glass access request
interface BreakGlassRequest {
  userId: string;
  workflowId: string;
  executionId: string;
  contextType: 'patient' | 'encounter' | 'organization';
  contextId: string;
  reason: string;
  requestedAt: string;
  ipAddress: string;
  deviceId?: string;
  approvalStatus: 'pending' | 'approved' | 'denied';
  approvedBy?: string;
  approvedAt?: string;
  expiresAt?: string;
  auditId: string; // Reference to detailed audit record
}
```
