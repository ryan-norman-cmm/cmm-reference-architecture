# API Marketplace Customization

## Introduction

This document provides guidelines and examples for customizing the API Marketplace component of the CMM Reference Architecture. Customization enables organizations to tailor the platformâ€™s features, workflows, and user interface to meet specific business and operational requirements.

## Custom User Interfaces

- **Theme Customization**: Modify the look and feel of the marketplace portal using custom CSS, branding, and layout adjustments.
- **Dashboard Configuration**: Create personalized dashboards for different user roles (e.g., administrators, developers) by rearranging widgets and reports.
- **Plugin-Based Widgets**: Integrate third-party widgets or build custom ones for additional data visualization and functionality.

## Custom Business Logic

- **Extended Validation Rules**: Supplement core API validation with custom business rules to ensure compliance with internal standards.
- **Workflow Automation**: Implement tailored approval or review workflows to align with organizational processes.
- **Custom Event Handlers**: Register event handlers to trigger notifications or logging actions based on specific API events (e.g., registration, update, deprecation).

## Integration Customization

- **Adapter Development**: Build custom adapters to integrate with legacy systems or third-party services that require non-standard protocols.
- **Data Transformation Pipelines**: Create middleware layers to translate or transform data between internal formats and external standards.

## Implementation Example

Below is a TypeScript example that extends the default API metadata validation with a custom rule:

```typescript
import { validateApiMetadata } from '@cmm/api-marketplace-core';

// Extend the default validation function with a custom rule
function customValidate(apiMetadata: any) {
  const baseValidation = validateApiMetadata(apiMetadata);
  
  // Custom rule: 'customField' is required
  if (!apiMetadata.customField || apiMetadata.customField.trim() === '') {
    return {
      valid: false,
      errors: [
        ...baseValidation.errors,
        { field: 'customField', message: 'customField is required for customization' }
      ]
    };
  }

  return baseValidation;
}

// Example usage in registration service:
// registrationService.setValidationFunction(customValidate);
```

## Best Practices

- **Modular Customizations**: Keep custom code isolated using plugins or adapters to ensure upgradability of the core platform.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Clearly document all customizations to facilitate maintenance and future enhancements.
- **Rigorous Testing**: Integrate custom logic into your testing framework for unit, integration, and functional tests.

## Conclusion

Customization empowers organizations to adapt the API Marketplace to their specific needs, enhancing user experience and aligning the platform with unique business processes.
