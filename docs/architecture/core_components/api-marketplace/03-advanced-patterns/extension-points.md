# API Marketplace Extension Points

## Introduction

This document outlines the extension points available in the API Marketplace component of the CMM Technology Platform. These extension points allow organizations to customize and extend the functionality of the API Marketplace to meet specific business requirements and integrate with external systems.

## Plugin Architecture

The API Marketplace is built with a modular plugin architecture that enables the integration of custom modules without modifying the core system. Common areas for extension include:

- **Authentication and Authorization**: Integrate custom authentication providers or additional security checks.
- **Analytics and Reporting**: Extend analytics capabilities by plugging in third-party analytics engines or custom dashboards.
- **API Transformation**: Customize request/response transformation pipelines to support non-standard data formats.
- **Custom Notifications**: Integrate with custom notification systems (email, SMS, Slack) for real-time alerts.

### Example: Custom Authentication Plugin

Developers can implement a custom authentication plugin by adhering to a standard interface:

```typescript
interface AuthPlugin {
  authenticate(request: any): Promise<boolean>;
  getUserDetails(token: string): Promise<any>;
}

// Example implementation
class CustomAuthPlugin implements AuthPlugin {
  async authenticate(request: any): Promise<boolean> {
    // Custom authentication logic here
    return true;
  }
  async getUserDetails(token: string): Promise<any> {
    // Fetch and return user details
    return { id: 'user-123', name: 'John Doe' };
  }
}

// Register the plugin
// PluginRegistry.register('customAuth', new CustomAuthPlugin());
```

## API Transformation Hooks

The API Marketplace supports transformation hooks that allow custom processing of API requests and responses. This can be used to:

- Insert custom headers or security tokens
- Transform payload data into a different schema
- Log requests for auditing purposes

### Example: Request Transformation Hook

```typescript
function requestTransformer(request: any): any {
  // Example: Add a custom header to all outgoing requests
  request.headers['X-Custom-Header'] = 'CustomValue';
  return request;
}

// Hook registration
// TransformationRegistry.registerRequestTransformer(requestTransformer);
```

## Custom Analytics Integrations

Organizations may extend the built-in analytics by integrating with external analytics platforms. Extension points include:

- **Event Emitters**: Customize events emitted on API registration, updates, or errors.
- **Metric Aggregators**: Extend how metrics are collected and aggregated.

### Example: Custom Event Emitter

```typescript
function customEventEmitter(event: string, data: any) {
  // Integrate with a third-party monitoring service
  console.log(`Emitting event: ${event}`, data);
  // e.g., send event data to an external system via REST API
}

// Register the emitter
// EventRegistry.register('customEmitter', customEventEmitter);
```

## Integration with Third-Party Systems

The API Marketplace provides extension points for integrating with third-party systems such as CRM, ERP, or legacy systems. This integration can occur via:

- Custom adapters for data synchronization
- Middleware for protocol translation
- API gateways that bridge between systems

## Conclusion

By utilizing these extension points, organizations can tailor the API Marketplace to their needs, adding custom authentication, data transformation, analytics, and integration capabilities. This flexibility ensures that the API Marketplace remains a central, extensible platform that evolves with business requirements.
