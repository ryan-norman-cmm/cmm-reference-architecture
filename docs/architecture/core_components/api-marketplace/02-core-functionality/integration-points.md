# API Marketplace Integration Points

## Introduction

This document outlines the integration points for the API Marketplace component within the CMM Technology Platform. It describes how the API Marketplace interacts with other core systems and external services to ensure seamless interoperability.

## Integration with Security and Access Framework

- **Authentication & Authorization**: Leverages OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect and JWT tokens for securing API access.
- **User Identity Management**: Integrates with centralized identity providers to manage user roles and permissions.

## Integration with Event Broker

- **Event-Driven Communication**: Publishes lifecycle events (registration, updates, deprecation) to the Event Broker for real-time processing and analytics.
- **Asynchronous Workflows**: Enables decoupled integration with other services through pub-sub messaging patterns.

## Integration with FHIR Interoperability Platform

- **FHIR API Registration**: Supports FHIR-compliant API registrations, including validation against FHIR standards.
- **Healthcare Data Exchange**: Facilitates the exchange of healthcare data via standardized FHIR resources and protocols.

## Integration with Federated Graph API

- **Unified Data Access**: Provides aggregated API data across multiple systems via the Federated Graph API.
- **Cross-Component Queries**: Allows seamless queries across different components, enabling richer insights and data correlation.

## API Client Integrations

- **SDKs and Tools**: Provides client SDKs (e.g., TypeScript/JavaScript) and interactive documentation (Swagger UI, GraphQL Playground) to simplify integration for developers.
- **Automation and Code Generation**: Supports automated client code generation from API specifications to streamline integration efforts.

## Summary

These integration points ensure that the API Marketplace is well-connected within the broader CMM Reference Architecture, enabling secure access, real-time event processing, and seamless data exchange across healthcare systems.
