# API Marketplace Key Concepts

## Introduction

This document outlines the key concepts and terminology used in the API Marketplace component of the CMM Technology Platform. Understanding these concepts is essential for effectively using and integrating with the API Marketplace.

## Core Concepts

### API Marketplace

The API Marketplace is a centralized platform for discovering, registering, and managing APIs across the healthcare organization. It serves as a single source of truth for API metadata, documentation, and governance.

### API Provider

An API Provider is an entity (team, department, or system) that creates and publishes APIs to the marketplace. Providers are responsible for maintaining their APIs, ensuring documentation quality, and supporting API consumers.

### API Consumer

An API Consumer is an entity that discovers and uses APIs from the marketplace. Consumers can browse available APIs, access documentation, request access, and integrate with APIs.

### API Catalog

The API Catalog is a comprehensive inventory of all APIs registered in the marketplace. It provides search, filtering, and browsing capabilities to help consumers discover relevant APIs.

### API Lifecycle

The API Lifecycle represents the stages an API goes through from planning to retirement. The API Marketplace manages and tracks these lifecycle stages, ensuring proper governance at each stage.

## API Registration Concepts

### API Specification

An API Specification is a formal definition of an API, typically using standards like OpenAPI (formerly Swagger), RAML, or GraphQL Schema. It describes endpoints, operations, parameters, responses, and data models.

### API Metadata

API Metadata includes descriptive information about an API, such as name, description, version, owner, tags, and categories. This metadata facilitates discovery and governance.

### API Documentation

API Documentation provides comprehensive information about how to use an API, including guides, examples, and reference material. The API Marketplace supports both auto-generated documentation from specifications and custom documentation.

### API Version

An API Version represents a specific iteration of an API. The API Marketplace supports versioning to allow APIs to evolve while maintaining backward compatibility for existing consumers.

## API Governance Concepts

### API Policy

An API Policy defines rules and constraints for APIs in the marketplace. Policies can cover areas such as security, performance, data quality, and compliance.

### API Quality Gate

An API Quality Gate is a checkpoint in the API lifecycle where specific quality criteria must be met before proceeding to the next stage. Quality gates ensure that APIs meet organizational standards.

### API Approval Workflow

The API Approval Workflow is a process for reviewing and approving APIs before they are published to the marketplace. It involves stakeholders such as security teams, compliance officers, and API governance boards.

### API SLA

An API Service Level Agreement (SLA) defines the expected performance, availability, and support levels for an API. The API Marketplace tracks and monitors SLAs to ensure compliance.

## API Security Concepts

### API Access Control

API Access Control manages who can access which APIs. The API Marketplace integrates with the Security and Access Framework to enforce access controls based on roles, attributes, and policies.

### API Key

An API Key is a unique identifier used to authenticate API consumers. The API Marketplace manages the issuance, rotation, and revocation of API keys.

### OAuth Scope

An OAuth Scope defines the level of access granted to an API consumer. The API Marketplace supports OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect for fine-grained access control.

### API Rate Limiting

API Rate Limiting controls how many requests a consumer can make to an API within a specific time period. The API Marketplace configures and enforces rate limits to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage.

## API Analytics Concepts

### API Usage Metrics

API Usage Metrics track how APIs are being used, including request volume, response times, error rates, and consumer adoption. The API Marketplace provides dashboards and reports for these metrics.

### API Health Monitoring

API Health Monitoring tracks the operational status of APIs, including availability, performance, and error rates. The API Marketplace integrates with monitoring systems to provide real-time health information.

### API Consumer Insights

API Consumer Insights provide information about who is using APIs, how they are using them, and what their experience is like. These insights help API providers improve their offerings.

## Healthcare-Specific Concepts

### FHIR API

FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) APIs are healthcare-specific APIs that follow the HL7 FHIR standard. The API Marketplace provides special support for FHIR APIs, including FHIR-specific metadata and validation.

### Healthcare Data Categories

Healthcare Data Categories classify APIs based on the type of healthcare data they handle, such as clinical, administrative, financial, or operational. These categories help consumers find relevant APIs.

### Compliance Classification

Compliance Classification indicates which regulatory requirements (such as HIPAA, GDPR, or 21 CFR Part 11) apply to an API. The API Marketplace tracks compliance requirements and ensures appropriate controls are in place.
