# API Marketplace

## Introduction

The API Marketplace is a comprehensive suite of integration technologies that enables seamless connectivity, security, and management of services across the CMM Reference Architecture. This marketplace approach combines best-of-breed solutions including F5 Distributed Cloud App Connect for universal ingress, a modern service mesh implementation, and Mulesoft for API integration and management. Together, these technologies provide a robust foundation for managing both internal and external APIs, securing service-to-service communication, and enabling consistent access to applications regardless of where they are deployed.

## Key Concepts

### Comprehensive Integration Strategy

The API Marketplace implements a multi-layered approach to integration:

- **Universal Ingress Layer**: Secure, consistent entry points for all external traffic
- **Service Mesh Layer**: Managed service-to-service communication within the platform
- **API Integration Layer**: Transformation, orchestration, and management of APIs
- **API Governance Layer**: Standardization, security, and lifecycle management

This layered approach ensures that each integration concern is addressed by the most appropriate technology while maintaining a cohesive overall architecture.
