# API Marketplace Release Lifecycle

## Introduction

This document outlines the release lifecycle for the API Marketplace component of the CMM Reference Architecture. It defines the stages, versioning strategy, release planning, change management, approval processes, rollback procedures, and communication strategies for API Marketplace releases.

- Final communication

## Versioning Strategy

The API Marketplace follows semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) to provide clear communication about the nature of changes in each release.

### Version Numbering

- **Major Version (X.0.0)**: Incremented for incompatible API changes, significant architectural changes, or major feature additions that may require user workflow changes. Major version changes may require migration efforts.

- **Minor Version (X.Y.0)**: Incremented for backward-compatible feature additions or enhancements. Minor version changes should not disrupt existing workflows or require significant migration efforts.

- **Patch Version (X.Y.Z)**: Incremented for backward-compatible bug fixes, security patches, or minor improvements that don't add new features. Patch releases should be safe to apply without disruption.

### Version Lifecycle

- **Alpha (X.Y.Z-alpha.N)**: Early development versions for internal testing only. May contain incomplete features and known issues.

- **Beta (X.Y.Z-beta.N)**: Pre-release versions for wider testing. Features are complete but may have bugs or performance issues.

- **Release Candidate (X.Y.Z-rc.N)**: Final testing versions before official release. Should have no known critical issues.

- **General Availability (X.Y.Z)**: Official release versions for production use. Fully tested and supported.

- **End of Life**: Versions that are no longer supported or maintained. Users should upgrade to a supported version.

## Release Planning

The API Marketplace follows a structured release planning process to ensure predictable, high-quality releases.

### Release Cadence

- **Major Releases**: Scheduled 1-2 times per year, with at least 3 months advance notice.

- **Minor Releases**: Scheduled quarterly, with at least 1 month advance notice.

- **Patch Releases**: Released as needed for bug fixes and security updates, typically within 1-2 weeks of issue identification for non-critical issues, and within 48 hours for critical security issues.

### Release Roadmap

The release roadmap is maintained in a public-facing document that outlines planned features and enhancements for upcoming releases. The roadmap is updated quarterly and includes:

- Planned features for the next 3-4 releases
- Estimated release dates
- Current development status
- Dependencies and prerequisites

### Feature Prioritization

Features are prioritized based on the following criteria:

1. Strategic alignment with organizational goals
2. Customer impact and business value
3. Technical dependencies and prerequisites
4. Implementation complexity and resource requirements
5. Regulatory and compliance requirements

## Change Management

The API Marketplace implements a structured change management process to ensure controlled, predictable changes with minimal disruption.

### Change Request Process

1. **Submission**: Change requests are submitted through the change management system with detailed description, justification, impact assessment, and implementation plan.

2. **Evaluation**: Changes are evaluated by the change advisory board (CAB) based on risk, impact, urgency, and resource requirements.

3. **Approval**: Changes require approval from relevant stakeholders, including technical leads, product management, and operations teams.

4. **Implementation**: Approved changes are implemented according to the implementation plan, with appropriate testing and validation.

5. **Verification**: Implemented changes are verified to ensure they meet requirements and don't introduce new issues.

### Change Categories

- **Standard Changes**: Pre-approved, low-risk changes that follow established procedures and don't require CAB approval for each instance.

- **Normal Changes**: Changes that require CAB review and approval before implementation.

- **Emergency Changes**: Urgent changes needed to resolve critical issues, following an expedited approval process.

### Change Windows

- **Regular Change Windows**: Scheduled weekly during low-traffic periods (typically Tuesday and Thursday, 10:00 PM - 2:00 AM EST).

- **Freeze Periods**: Change freezes are implemented during critical business periods, holidays, or major events. These are communicated at least 2 weeks in advance.

## Release Approval

Each release goes through a formal approval process before deployment to production.

### Approval Criteria

- All functional requirements are implemented and tested
- No open critical or high-severity defects
- Performance meets or exceeds established benchmarks
- Security assessment completed with no critical vulnerabilities
- Documentation is complete and accurate
- User acceptance testing completed with sign-off
- Deployment and rollback plans are documented and tested

### Approval Gates

1. **Development Complete**: All features are implemented, unit tested, and code reviewed.

2. **QA Approval**: All test cases executed with acceptable pass rate, no critical defects.

3. **Security Approval**: Security assessment completed with no critical vulnerabilities.

4. **Documentation Approval**: All documentation updated and reviewed.

5. **UAT Approval**: User acceptance testing completed with stakeholder sign-off.

6. **Operations Approval**: Deployment plan reviewed and approved by operations team.

7. **Final Release Approval**: Final go/no-go decision by release manager and key stakeholders.

## Rollback Procedures

The API Marketplace implements comprehensive rollback procedures to quickly recover from failed deployments or critical issues.

### Rollback Triggers

- Critical functionality is broken or unavailable
- Security vulnerability is discovered in the release
- Performance degradation beyond acceptable thresholds
- Data integrity issues are detected
- Integration with critical systems is broken

### Rollback Process

1. **Decision**: Release manager, in consultation with technical leads and operations, makes the rollback decision based on impact assessment.

2. **Communication**: Immediate notification to all stakeholders about the rollback decision and expected impact.

3. **Execution**: Rollback to the previous stable version using automated deployment tools.

4. **Verification**: Verification that the rollback was successful and the system is functioning correctly.

5. **Root Cause Analysis**: Investigation of the issues that triggered the rollback to prevent recurrence.

### Recovery Time Objectives

- **Critical Issues**: Rollback initiated within 30 minutes of issue detection, completed within 1 hour.

- **Major Issues**: Rollback initiated within 2 hours of issue detection, completed within 4 hours.

- **Minor Issues**: Evaluated case-by-case, may be addressed with a patch release instead of rollback.

## Release Communication

The API Marketplace implements a comprehensive communication strategy for releases to ensure all stakeholders are informed and prepared.

### Communication Channels

- **Release Notes**: Detailed documentation of new features, improvements, bug fixes, and known issues.

- **Email Notifications**: Targeted emails to stakeholders with release highlights and important changes.

- **Announcement Portal**: Central location for all release announcements and documentation.

- **Webinars and Demos**: Live presentations of major new features and changes.

- **Support Channels**: Updates to support teams with detailed information about changes and potential issues.

### Communication Timeline

- **3 Months Before Major Release**: Initial announcement of planned major release with high-level roadmap.

- **1 Month Before Release**: Detailed release preview with feature list, breaking changes, and migration guidance.

- **2 Weeks Before Release**: Final release date confirmation and reminder of important changes.

- **Day of Release**: Release announcement with links to release notes and documentation.

- **1 Week After Release**: Follow-up communication with any post-release updates, fixes, or additional information.

### Communication Content

- **New Features**: Description of new features and enhancements with usage examples.

- **Breaking Changes**: Clear identification of breaking changes with migration guidance.

- **Bug Fixes**: List of resolved issues with reference to original issue numbers.

- **Known Issues**: Transparent communication about known issues with workarounds if available.

- **Deprecations**: Notice of deprecated features with timeline for removal and migration options.

- **Security Updates**: Information about security fixes (without exposing vulnerabilities).
