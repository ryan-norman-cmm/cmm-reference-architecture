# API Marketplace CI/CD Pipeline

## Introduction

This document describes the Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for the API Marketplace component of the CMM Technology Platform. The CI/CD pipeline automates the building, testing, and deployment processes, ensuring consistent, reliable, and efficient delivery of the API Marketplace component across different environments.

## Pipeline Overview

The API Marketplace CI/CD pipeline follows a modern DevOps approach with automated stages from code commit to production deployment. The pipeline is designed to ensure code quality, security, and reliability throughout the software delivery lifecycle.

```

## Pipeline Stages

### Code Commit

The pipeline begins when code is committed to the repository:

- **Source Control**: GitHub repository for API Marketplace code
- **Branch Strategy**: GitFlow with feature branches, develop, release, and main branches
- **Pull Request Process**: Required code reviews, automated checks, and approval workflows
- **Commit Hooks**: Pre-commit hooks for code formatting and linting

### Build

The build stage compiles the code and prepares it for testing:

- **Build Tool**: Node.js with npm/yarn for backend, webpack for frontend
- **Build Environment**: Containerized build environment with Node.js 18
- **Dependency Management**: Automated dependency resolution and lockfile validation
- **Build Artifacts**: Compiled JavaScript, bundled assets, and Docker images

### Test

Comprehensive testing ensures code quality and functionality:

- **Unit Tests**: Jest for component and function-level testing
- **API Tests**: Supertest for API endpoint testing
- **Component Tests**: React Testing Library for frontend component testing

        docker tag api-marketplace-backend:${{ github.sha }} api-marketplace-backend:latest

    - name: Push Docker image
      run: |
        echo ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }} | docker login -u ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }} --password-stdin
        docker push api-marketplace-backend:${{ github.sha }}
        docker push api-marketplace-backend:latest
```

### Frontend Build

```yaml

- **Package Lock**: package-lock.json or yarn.lock enforced in version control
- **Dependency Updates**: Automated with Dependabot
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Automated with npm audit and Snyk
- **License Compliance**: Checked with license-checker

## Deployment Process

The deployment process uses a GitOps approach with Helm and ArgoCD:

### Helm Chart Structure

```
api-marketplace/
├── Chart.yaml
├── values.yaml
├── values-dev.yaml
├── values-test.yaml
├── values-staging.yaml
├── values-prod.yaml
└── templates/
    ├── deployment.yaml
    ├── service.yaml
    ├── ingress.yaml
    ├── configmap.yaml
    ├── secret.yaml
    └── hpa.yaml
```

### ArgoCD Application Definition

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: api-marketplace
  namespace: argocd
spec:
  project: default
  source:
    repoURL: https://github.com/cmm-reference-architecture/api-marketplace.git
    targetRevision: HEAD
    path: helm/api-marketplace
    helm:
      valueFiles:
        - values-prod.yaml
  destination:
    server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
    namespace: api-marketplace
  syncPolicy:
    automated:
      prune: true
      selfHeal: true
    syncOptions:
      - CreateNamespace=true
```

### Blue-Green Deployment

Production deployments use a blue-green strategy for zero downtime:

```yaml
# Blue-Green deployment configuration
blue-green:
  enabled: true
  activeService: blue
  services:
    blue:
      name: api-marketplace-blue
      label: app.kubernetes.io/name=api-marketplace,app.kubernetes.io/instance=blue
    green:
      name: api-marketplace-green
      label: app.kubernetes.io/name=api-marketplace,app.kubernetes.io/instance=green
  autoPromotionEnabled: false
  autoPromotionSeconds: 600
  scaleDownDelaySeconds: 300
  previewService: preview-api-marketplace
```

## Environment Management

The CI/CD pipeline manages multiple environments with different configurations:

### Environment Configuration

Environment-specific configuration is managed through Helm values files:

```yaml
# Example values-dev.yaml
replicaCount: 1

image:
  repository: api-marketplace-backend
  tag: latest
  pullPolicy: Always

resources:
  limits:
    cpu: 500m
    memory: 512Mi
  requests:
    cpu: 100m
    memory: 128Mi

database:
  host: mongodb-dev
  port: 27017
  name: apimarketplace
  authEnabled: true

logging:
  level: debug

featureFlags:
  enableAnalytics: true
  enableVersioning: true
```

### Environment Promotion

Code changes flow through environments in a controlled manner:

1. **Development**: Automatic deployment from the develop branch
2. **Test**: Automatic deployment after successful integration tests
3. **Staging**: Manual approval required before deployment
4. **Production**: Manual approval required with additional security checks

### Configuration Management

Sensitive configuration is managed securely:

- **Secrets Management**: HashiCorp Vault for secrets storage
- **Secret Injection**: Kubernetes External Secrets for secret injection
- **Configuration Validation**: Automated validation of configuration values
- **Audit Trail**: All configuration changes are tracked and audited

## Pipeline Security

The CI/CD pipeline implements several security controls:

### Secrets Management

- **No Hardcoded Secrets**: All secrets stored in secure vaults
- **Least Privilege**: Pipeline uses minimal required permissions
- **Secret Rotation**: Regular rotation of pipeline credentials
- **Access Auditing**: All secret access is logged and audited

### Build Environment Security

- **Isolated Build Environments**: Each build runs in an isolated container
- **Ephemeral Credentials**: Temporary credentials for build processes
- **Dependency Scanning**: All dependencies scanned for vulnerabilities
- **Image Scanning**: All container images scanned before deployment

### Deployment Security

- **Immutable Infrastructure**: Deployments create new resources rather than modifying existing ones
- **Deployment Verification**: Automated verification after deployment
- **Rollback Capability**: Automated rollback for failed deployments
- **Audit Trail**: All deployments are logged and audited

## Healthcare-Specific Considerations

### Compliance Validation

The pipeline includes healthcare-specific compliance checks:

- **HIPAA Compliance**: Automated checks for HIPAA Technical Safeguards
- **GDPR Compliance**: Validation of data protection measures
- **21 CFR Part 11**: Checks for electronic records and signatures compliance
- **HITRUST**: Alignment with HITRUST CSF requirements

### PHI Protection

The pipeline includes special protections for Protected Health Information (PHI):

- **PHI Detection**: Automated scanning for PHI in test data
- **Data Masking**: Masking of PHI in non-production environments
- **Access Controls**: Strict controls on PHI access during deployment
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all PHI access

## Monitoring and Feedback

The pipeline includes monitoring and feedback mechanisms:

### Pipeline Metrics

- **Build Time**: Time taken for each build
- **Test Coverage**: Code coverage percentage
- **Success Rate**: Percentage of successful pipeline runs
- **Deployment Frequency**: Frequency of deployments to each environment

### Notification System

- **Slack Integration**: Real-time notifications in Slack channels
- **Email Alerts**: Email notifications for critical events
- **Dashboard**: Real-time pipeline status dashboard
- **Mobile Alerts**: Critical alerts sent to mobile devices

## Best Practices

### Pipeline Optimization

- **Parallel Execution**: Run independent steps in parallel
- **Caching**: Cache dependencies and build artifacts
- **Incremental Builds**: Build only what has changed
- **Test Prioritization**: Run critical tests first

### Quality Gates

- **Automated Quality Gates**: Automated checks that must pass before proceeding
- **Manual Approvals**: Strategic manual approval points for critical stages
- **Compliance Checks**: Automated compliance validation
- **Performance Thresholds**: Minimum performance requirements
