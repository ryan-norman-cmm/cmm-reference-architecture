# Design System Overview

## Introduction
The Design System provides reusable UI components, design patterns, and accessibility standards for building cohesive healthcare applications. It ensures consistent user experiences across the platform while accelerating development through standardized, accessible, and thoroughly tested components.

## Key Features
- Accessible, WCAG 2.1 AA compliant components
- Healthcare-specific UI patterns and workflows
- Consistent design language and tokens
- Comprehensive documentation and examples
- Automated testing and quality assurance
- Theming and customization capabilities

## Architecture Overview
- The Design System is built on React and Tailwind CSS, with ShadCN UI as the component foundation.
- It implements a composable architecture where atomic components can be assembled into more complex patterns.
- The system includes design tokens, component libraries, and pattern documentation.

## Integration Points
- Integrates with frontend applications across the platform
- Connects with the Federated Graph API for data fetching patterns
- Provides consistent UI for healthcare data from the FHIR Interoperability Platform
- Supports API Marketplace developer portal interfaces

## Use Cases
- Building consistent healthcare applications and portals
- Implementing accessible user interfaces for diverse users
- Accelerating UI development through reusable components
- Ensuring brand consistency across multiple applications
- Supporting complex healthcare workflows with validated patterns
