# Design Principles

## Introduction

The design principles of the CMM Reference Architecture Design System serve as the foundation for all design decisions. These principles guide the creation of consistent, accessible, and effective healthcare applications that meet the needs of all users, from patients to healthcare professionals.

## Core Principles

### 1. Clarity

**Information is presented clearly and efficiently**

In healthcare applications, clarity is paramount. Users must be able to quickly understand and act on information, especially in critical care situations.

#### Guidelines:

- Use clear, concise language free of jargon (unless appropriate for clinical users)
- Present information in a logical hierarchy with the most important details emphasized
- Minimize visual noise and unnecessary decorative elements
- Ensure text has sufficient contrast and appropriate sizing
- Use visual cues to guide attention to important information

#### Examples:

- Critical alerts use distinctive colors and icons to stand out
- Patient information is organized in a consistent, scannable format
- Form fields have clear labels and validation messages

### 2. Consistency

**Patterns and interactions are consistent throughout the system**

Consistency creates familiarity and reduces cognitive load, allowing users to focus on their tasks rather than learning new interfaces.

#### Guidelines:

- Maintain consistent component behavior across the application
- Use established patterns for common interactions
- Apply design tokens consistently for visual coherence
- Follow platform conventions when appropriate
- Ensure terminology is consistent throughout the application

#### Examples:

- Buttons with the same function have the same appearance across the application
- Navigation patterns follow a consistent model
- Error states and feedback mechanisms are handled consistently

### 3. Accessibility

**Designs are usable by all people, including those with disabilities**

Healthcare applications must be accessible to everyone, including users with disabilities and those in various contexts and environments.

#### Guidelines:

- Meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards at minimum
- Design for keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility
- Ensure sufficient color contrast for all text and interactive elements
- Provide alternatives for non-text content
- Test with assistive technologies and users with disabilities

#### Examples:

- All interactive elements have focus states
- Color is never the sole means of conveying information
- Form errors are communicated both visually and textually

### 4. Efficiency

**Workflows are optimized for healthcare professionals' needs**

Healthcare professionals often work under time pressure and in demanding environments. The design should minimize friction and support efficient workflows.

#### Guidelines:

- Minimize the number of steps required to complete common tasks
- Provide keyboard shortcuts for frequent actions
- Design for quick scanning of information
- Optimize loading times and performance
- Support batch operations where appropriate

#### Examples:

- Critical patient information is visible without scrolling
- Common actions are prominently placed and easily accessible
- Search functionality is optimized for clinical terminology

### 5. Trust

**Design builds confidence through reliability and accuracy**

Users must trust the system to provide accurate information and behave reliably, especially when making clinical decisions.

#### Guidelines:

- Clearly communicate system status and changes
- Provide appropriate feedback for user actions
- Design error states that help users recover
- Ensure data accuracy and currency is evident
- Handle sensitive information with appropriate privacy measures

#### Examples:

- Timestamps show when data was last updated
- Confirmation dialogs prevent accidental actions with significant consequences
- System status indicators show connectivity and synchronization state

## Applying the Principles

These principles should be applied throughout the design and development process:

1. **During ideation**: Use the principles to evaluate early concepts and ideas
2. **During design**: Reference the principles when making design decisions
3. **During implementation**: Ensure technical solutions uphold the principles
4. **During testing**: Evaluate the application against the principles
5. **During iteration**: Use the principles to guide improvements

## Resolving Conflicts

When principles come into conflict, consider the specific context and user needs. In healthcare applications, safety and clarity often take precedence, but each situation should be evaluated individually.

For example, if a highly efficient design reduces clarity for novice users, consider whether the application is primarily used by experts or if alternative approaches could maintain efficiency while improving clarity.

## Conclusion

These design principles provide a framework for creating healthcare applications that are clear, consistent, accessible, efficient, and trustworthy. By adhering to these principles, we can create experiences that support healthcare professionals and patients alike, ultimately contributing to better healthcare outcomes.
