# Governance and Contribution Guidelines

## Governance Structure

The CMM Reference Architecture Design System is governed by a structured approach that balances centralized oversight with distributed contribution. This structure ensures the design system remains consistent, maintainable, and aligned with organizational goals.

### Design System Team

The core team responsible for the day-to-day management of the design system:

- **Design System Lead**: Overall responsibility for the design system strategy and direction
- **Lead Designer**: Responsible for visual design, user experience, and design tokens
- **Lead Developer**: Responsible for component implementation, documentation, and technical standards
- **Accessibility Specialist**: Ensures all components meet accessibility requirements
- **Clinical UX Specialist**: Provides healthcare-specific expertise and clinical workflow knowledge
- **Compliance Officer**: Ensures alignment with healthcare regulations and standards

### Design System Council

A cross-functional group that provides strategic guidance and approves major changes:

- **Product Leadership**: Representatives from key product areas
- **Design Leadership**: Design directors or managers
- **Engineering Leadership**: Engineering directors or managers
- **Clinical Representatives**: Physicians, nurses, and other clinical stakeholders
- **Compliance Representatives**: Privacy, security, and regulatory experts
- **Accessibility Experts**: Internal or external accessibility specialists

### Working Groups

Specialized teams focused on specific aspects of the design system:

- **Component Working Group**: Develops and maintains core components
- **Pattern Working Group**: Develops and maintains clinical patterns and workflows
- **Accessibility Working Group**: Ensures accessibility compliance
- **Healthcare Compliance Working Group**: Addresses healthcare-specific compliance requirements
- **Documentation Working Group**: Creates and maintains documentation

## Decision-Making Process

### Change Management

The design system uses a structured process for managing changes:

#### 1. Request

Changes begin with a formal request, which can come from:
- Design system team members
- Product teams
- Clinical stakeholders
- Compliance requirements
- User research findings

#### 2. Triage

Requests are triaged by the design system team based on:
- Strategic alignment
- User impact
- Technical feasibility
- Compliance requirements
- Resource availability

#### 3. Evaluation

Approved requests undergo detailed evaluation:
- Design exploration
- Technical assessment
- Accessibility review
- Compliance review
- User testing (when appropriate)

#### 4. Approval

Changes require approval at different levels based on impact:
- **Minor Changes**: Design system team approval
- **Significant Changes**: Working group approval
- **Major Changes**: Design system council approval

#### 5. Implementation

Approved changes are implemented following established standards:
- Design specifications
- Component development
- Documentation updates
- Testing and validation

#### 6. Release

Changes are released according to the versioning strategy:
- Version number updates
- Release notes
- Migration guides (if needed)
- Notification to stakeholders

  size?: "default" | "sm" | "lg" | "icon";
  
  /**
   * The element to render as (polymorphic component)
   */
  asChild?: boolean;
  
  /**

   */
  className?: string;
}

/**
 * Button component for user interactions
 * 
 * @example
 * ```tsx
 * <Button variant="clinical" onClick={handleSave}>Save Patient</Button>
 * ```
 * 
 * @accessibility
 * - Ensures keyboard focus styles with focus-visible utility
 * - Disabled state properly handled with aria-disabled
 * - Touch target size meets WCAG requirements
 * 
 * @compliance
 * - Meets WCAG 2.1 AA requirements
 * - Clinical variant follows healthcare UI guidelines

- More stable implementation
- Basic documentation available
- Limited production use with caution
- Feedback actively collected

### 3. Stable

- Fully implemented and tested
- Comprehensive documentation
- Recommended for production use
- Regular maintenance and updates

## Version Control and Release Management

### Versioning Strategy

The design system follows semantic versioning (SemVer):

- **Major Version (X.0.0)**: Breaking changes that require updates to consuming applications
- **Minor Version (0.X.0)**: New features or components added in a backward-compatible manner
- **Patch Version (0.0.X)**: Bug fixes and minor updates that don't affect functionality

### Release Cadence

- **Patch Releases**: As needed for critical fixes
- **Minor Releases**: Monthly or quarterly, depending on feature development
- **Major Releases**: Scheduled 2-4 times per year, with advance notice

### Release Process

    F --> C
    E -->|No| G[Documentation Updates]
    G --> H[Release Approval]
    H --> I[Publish Release]
    I --> J[Release Communication]
```

1. **Release Planning**: Identifying changes for inclusion
2. **Feature Freeze**: Cut-off for new feature additions
3. **Release Candidate**: Creation of release candidate
4. **Testing & Validation**: Comprehensive testing
5. **Documentation Updates**: Ensuring all changes are documented
6. **Release Approval**: Final review by appropriate stakeholders
7. **Publish Release**: Publishing to repositories
8. **Release Communication**: Notifying stakeholders

## Quality Assurance

### Testing Standards

All components undergo rigorous testing:

- **Unit Testing**: Component functionality
- **Integration Testing**: Component interactions
- **Accessibility Testing**: WCAG compliance
- **Cross-Browser Testing**: Support for required browsers

```jsx
// Example: Button component test
import { render, screen, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react';
import { axe, toHaveNoViolations } from 'jest-axe';
import { Button } from './Button';

// Extend Jest with accessibility matchers
expect.extend(toHaveNoViolations);

describe('Button', () => {
  it('renders correctly with default props', () => {
    render(<Button>Click me</Button>);
    const button = screen.getByRole('button', { name: /click me/i });
    expect(button).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(button).toHaveClass('bg-primary');
  });
  
  it('renders with different variants', () => {
    const { rerender } = render(<Button variant="clinical">Clinical</Button>);
    expect(screen.getByRole('button')).toHaveClass('bg-clinical');
    
    rerender(<Button variant="destructive">Destructive</Button>);
    expect(screen.getByRole('button')).toHaveClass('bg-destructive');
  });
  
  it('handles click events', () => {
    const handleClick = jest.fn();
    render(<Button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</Button>);
    
    fireEvent.click(screen.getByRole('button'));
    expect(handleClick).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
  });
  
  it('is disabled when disabled prop is true', () => {
    render(<Button disabled>Disabled</Button>);
    const button = screen.getByRole('button');
    
    expect(button).toBeDisabled();
    expect(button).toHaveClass('disabled:opacity-50');
  });
  
  it('has no accessibility violations', async () => {
    const { container } = render(<Button>Accessible Button</Button>);
    const results = await axe(container);
    
    expect(results).toHaveNoViolations();
  });
