# Maintenance and Support

## Introduction

Effective maintenance and support are essential for ensuring the long-term success and adoption of the CMM Technology Platform Design System. This document outlines the strategies, processes, and best practices for maintaining the design system and providing support to its users.

## Maintenance Strategy

### Regular Updates

The design system follows a structured update schedule to ensure continuous improvement while maintaining stability:

#### Update Cadence

- **Patch Releases (0.0.x)**: As needed for bug fixes and minor improvements
- **Minor Releases (0.x.0)**: Monthly or bi-monthly for new features and enhancements
- **Major Releases (x.0.0)**: 2-4 times per year for breaking changes and significant updates

#### Update Types

1. **Bug Fixes**
   - Critical bugs: Addressed immediately through hotfix releases
   - Non-critical bugs: Grouped into regular patch releases

2. **Enhancements**
   - Component improvements
   - Performance optimizations
   - Accessibility improvements

3. **New Features**
   - New components
   - New variants for existing components
   - New patterns and utilities

4. **Breaking Changes**
   - API changes
   - Style system updates
   - Dependency upgrades

### Dependency Management

Dependencies are managed with a structured approach to ensure stability and security:

#### Dependency Update Strategy

1. **Regular Audits**
   - Weekly automated security audits
   - Monthly dependency health checks
   - Quarterly major version evaluations

2. **Update Prioritization**
   - Security updates: Highest priority, addressed immediately
   - Bug fixes: High priority, included in next patch release
   - Feature updates: Medium priority, included in next minor release
   - Major version updates: Low priority, carefully evaluated and tested

3. **Compatibility Testing**
   - Automated testing for all dependency updates
   - Integration testing with consuming applications
   - Performance impact assessment

#### Peer Dependency Management

Clear communication about peer dependency requirements:

```json
// Example: package.json peer dependencies
{
  "name": "@cmm/design-system",
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "peerDependencies": {
    "react": "^18.0.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.0.0",
    "tailwindcss": "^3.3.0"
  },
  "peerDependenciesMeta": {
    "tailwindcss": {
      "optional": false
    }
  }
}
```

### Technical Debt Management

A proactive approach to managing technical debt:

1. **Debt Identification**
   - Regular code quality audits
   - Performance profiling
   - Accessibility audits
   - Developer feedback collection

2. **Debt Prioritization**
   - Impact assessment
   - Effort estimation
   - Risk evaluation
   - User impact analysis

3. **Debt Reduction**
   - Dedicated technical debt sprints
   - Incremental improvements alongside feature work
   - Refactoring plans for high-impact areas

#### Technical Debt Tracking
