2. **Layout Components**: Cards, Containers, Grids, Dividers
3. **Navigation Components**: Tabs, Breadcrumbs, Menus, Pagination
4. **Feedback Components**: Alerts, Toasts, Progress indicators, Skeletons
5. **Data Display Components**: Tables, Lists, Charts, Calendars
6. **Healthcare-Specific Components**: Patient banners, Vital sign displays, Clinical timelines, Medication lists

### Component Explorer

The Component Explorer is an interactive tool for exploring and experimenting with components. It provides:

- Live component examples
- Editable props and configurations
- Generated code snippets
- Theme customization options
- Accessibility checks
