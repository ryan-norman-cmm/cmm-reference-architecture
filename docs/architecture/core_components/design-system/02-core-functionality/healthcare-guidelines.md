# Healthcare-Specific Guidelines

## Introduction

the CMM Technology Platform Design System includes specialized guidelines for healthcare applications to address the unique requirements of clinical environments, patient interactions, and regulatory compliance. These guidelines ensure that our applications not only look consistent but also support the specific needs of healthcare professionals and patients.

## Clinical Data Display

### Patient Identification

Patient identification must be clear, consistent, and prominently displayed to prevent errors.

#### Guidelines:

- Always display at least two patient identifiers (e.g., name and date of birth)
- Use a consistent patient banner across all clinical screens
- Include a recent photo when available to aid in identification
- Clearly indicate when viewing test patients or training environments

#### Example Implementation:

```jsx
<PatientBanner
  patientId="12345"
  className="sticky top-0 z-10 mb-4"
/>
```

### Clinical Alerts and Warnings

Clinical alerts must be prioritized and displayed according to severity to prevent alert fatigue while ensuring critical information is noticed.

#### Alert Hierarchy:

1. **Critical Alerts**: Require immediate attention, potentially life-threatening
   - Use `--critical` color with high-contrast icon
   - Consider modal dialogs for blocking interactions
   - Example: Severe drug-drug interaction, critical lab value

2. **High Priority Alerts**: Require prompt attention
   - Use `--high` color with distinctive icon
   - Example: Abnormal vital signs, allergies

3. **Medium Priority Alerts**: Important but not urgent
   - Use `--medium` color
   - Example: Overdue preventive care, non-critical drug interaction

4. **Low Priority Alerts**: Informational
   - Use `--low` color or `--info` color
   - Example: New message, order status update

#### Example Implementation:

```jsx
<Alert 
  variant="critical"
  title="Critical Lab Value"
  description="Potassium: 6.8 mmol/L (Critical High)"
  action={<Button variant="destructive">Acknowledge</Button>}
/>
```

### Vital Signs Display

Vital signs should be displayed with clear indication of normal ranges and trends.

#### Guidelines:

- Use color coding to indicate values outside normal ranges
- Provide visual indicators for trends (improving/worsening)
- Include reference ranges when displaying values
- Support both tabular and graphical views

#### Example Implementation:

```jsx
<VitalSigns
  vitals={patientVitals}
  showTrends={true}
  className="mb-6"
/>
```

### Medication Display

Medication information must be clear, complete, and support safe prescribing practices.

#### Guidelines:

- Display complete medication information (name, dose, route, frequency)
- Clearly differentiate between brand and generic names
- Highlight high-alert medications
- Provide access to relevant medication references
- Support barcode medication administration workflows

#### Example Implementation:

```jsx
<MedicationList
  medications={patientMedications}
  highlightHighAlert={true}
  showAdministrationTimes={true}
/>
```

## Privacy Considerations

### Protected Health Information (PHI)

Applications must handle PHI in accordance with HIPAA and other relevant regulations.

#### Guidelines:

- Implement automatic session timeouts with appropriate timing
- Provide clear visual indication when PHI is displayed
- Include privacy indicators for shared or public screens
- Support secure printing with appropriate headers/footers
- Implement break-glass procedures for emergency access

#### Example Implementation:

```jsx
<PrivacyWrapper
  timeoutMinutes={15}
  sensitivityLevel="high"
  onTimeout={() => handleSessionTimeout()}
>
  <PatientChart patientId={patientId} />
</PrivacyWrapper>
```

### Consent and Authorization

Applications must respect patient consent and user authorization.

#### Guidelines:

- Clearly indicate when information is being shared based on consent
- Show authorization status for sensitive information
- Provide mechanisms to document and update consent
- Support role-based access control with clear visual indicators

## Clinical Workflows

### Order Entry

Order entry interfaces must support efficient and safe ordering practices.

#### Guidelines:

- Group related orders logically
- Support common order sets and favorites
- Provide appropriate clinical decision support
- Include clear confirmation steps for high-risk orders
- Support mobile and desktop workflows

### Documentation

Clinical documentation interfaces must balance efficiency with completeness.

#### Guidelines:

- Support progressive disclosure of complex forms
- Provide appropriate templates and defaults
- Implement auto-save functionality
- Support voice dictation where appropriate
- Enable efficient review of previous documentation

### Handoffs and Transitions of Care

Interfaces supporting handoffs must ensure critical information is communicated.

#### Guidelines:

- Highlight key information needed during handoffs
- Support structured communication frameworks (e.g., SBAR)
- Provide mechanisms to acknowledge receipt of handoff
- Include tools for reconciliation during transitions

## Regulatory Compliance

### Accessibility for Healthcare

Healthcare applications have unique accessibility considerations beyond standard WCAG requirements.

#### Guidelines:

- Support high-contrast modes for clinical environments
- Ensure usability with PPE (e.g., gloves)
- Design for use in varied lighting conditions
- Support screen readers with appropriate pronunciation of medical terms
- Ensure keyboard accessibility for clinical workflows

### Audit and Logging

Interfaces must support appropriate audit trails and logging.

#### Guidelines:

- Provide clear indication when actions are being logged
- Support review of audit information when appropriate
- Include timestamps and user information in logs
- Design interfaces for compliance investigations

### 21 CFR Part 11 Compliance

For applications requiring FDA compliance, additional considerations apply.

#### Guidelines:

- Support electronic signatures with appropriate controls
- Implement proper audit trails for regulated functions
- Design interfaces for validation documentation
- Include appropriate system checks and validations

## Patient-Facing Considerations

### Health Literacy

Patient-facing interfaces must accommodate varying levels of health literacy.

#### Guidelines:

- Use plain language (aim for 6th-8th grade reading level)
- Provide definitions for medical terms
- Use appropriate visualizations to support understanding
- Test with users of varying health literacy levels

### Patient Engagement

Interfaces should support patient engagement and self-management.

#### Guidelines:

- Design for motivation and behavior change
- Support goal setting and tracking
- Provide appropriate feedback and reinforcement
- Include educational resources at point of need

## Implementation Resources

### Component Examples

The design system includes healthcare-specific components that implement these guidelines:

- `<PatientBanner>`: Consistent patient identification
- `<VitalSigns>`: Display of vital signs with normal ranges
- `<ClinicalTimeline>`: Visualization of clinical events over time
- `<MedicationList>`: Structured display of medications
- `<AlertManager>`: Prioritized clinical alerts

### Pattern Examples

Common healthcare patterns are documented with examples:

- Clinical documentation workflows
- Medication reconciliation
- Order entry and review
- Clinical decision support
- Patient education

## Conclusion

These healthcare-specific guidelines ensure that applications built with the CMM Technology Platform Design System not only look consistent but also address the unique requirements of healthcare environments. By following these guidelines, we can create applications that support safe, efficient, and effective healthcare delivery while meeting regulatory requirements and enhancing the experience for both healthcare professionals and patients.
