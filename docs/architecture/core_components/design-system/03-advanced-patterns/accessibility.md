# Accessibility Guidelines

## Introduction

Accessibility is a core principle of the CMM Technology Platform Design System. Our healthcare applications must be usable by everyone, including people with disabilities and those in various contexts and environments. This document provides comprehensive guidelines for ensuring accessibility across all components and applications.

## WCAG Compliance

All components in our design system must meet or exceed the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA standards. This includes:

### 1. Perceivable

- **Text Alternatives**: Provide text alternatives for non-text content
- **Time-based Media**: Provide alternatives for time-based media
- **Adaptable**: Create content that can be presented in different ways
- **Distinguishable**: Make it easier for users to see and hear content

### 2. Operable

- **Keyboard Accessible**: Make all functionality available from a keyboard
- **Enough Time**: Provide users enough time to read and use content
- **Seizures and Physical Reactions**: Do not design content in a way that causes seizures or physical reactions
- **Navigable**: Provide ways to help users navigate and find content
- **Input Modalities**: Make it easier for users to operate functionality through various inputs

### 3. Understandable

- **Readable**: Make text content readable and understandable
- **Predictable**: Make web pages appear and operate in predictable ways
- **Input Assistance**: Help users avoid and correct mistakes

### 4. Robust

- **Compatible**: Maximize compatibility with current and future user tools

## Healthcare-Specific Accessibility Considerations

Healthcare applications have unique accessibility requirements beyond standard WCAG guidelines:

### Clinical Environment Considerations

- **Variable Lighting**: Components must be usable in both dimly lit and brightly lit environments
- **Gloved Operation**: Touch interfaces must work with medical gloves
- **Infection Control**: Interfaces should support non-touch alternatives where possible
- **Urgent Situations**: Critical functions must be accessible during urgent clinical situations

### Patient-Facing Considerations

- **Health Literacy**: Content must be understandable across varying health literacy levels
- **Age-Related Impairments**: Interfaces must accommodate age-related vision, hearing, and motor impairments
- **Temporary Disabilities**: Consider patients with temporary impairments due to illness or treatment
- **Medication Effects**: Account for potential medication effects on perception and cognition

## Implementation Guidelines

### Keyboard Navigation

All interactive elements must be fully operable using only a keyboard:

- Ensure a visible focus indicator for all interactive elements
- Maintain a logical tab order that follows the visual layout
- Provide keyboard shortcuts for frequently used actions
- Ensure dropdown menus and complex widgets are keyboard accessible

```jsx
// Example of proper keyboard handling in a component
function AccessibleButton({ children, onClick, ...props }) {
  const handleKeyDown = (event) => {
    if (event.key === 'Enter' || event.key === ' ') {
      event.preventDefault();
      onClick(event);
    }
  };

  return (
    <button
      onClick={onClick}
      onKeyDown={handleKeyDown}
      tabIndex={0}
      {...props}
    >
      {children}
    </button>
  );
}
```

### Screen Reader Support

Ensure all components work properly with screen readers:

- Use semantic HTML elements whenever possible
- Provide ARIA attributes when necessary
- Ensure dynamic content changes are announced appropriately
- Test with multiple screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)

```jsx
// Example of proper ARIA usage
<div role="alert" aria-live="assertive">
  {errorMessage}
</div>
```

### Color and Contrast

Ensure sufficient color contrast and never rely solely on color to convey information:

- Maintain a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text
- Provide additional indicators beyond color (icons, patterns, text)
- Support high contrast mode
- Test interfaces in grayscale to ensure usability without color

```css
/* Example of color-independent status indicators */
.status-critical {
  color: var(--critical);
  border-left: 4px solid var(--critical);
  padding-left: 0.5rem;
}

.status-critical::before {
  content: "⚠️";
  margin-right: 0.5rem;
}
```

### Focus Management

Manage focus appropriately, especially in single-page applications and dynamic interfaces:

- Return focus to a logical location after actions
- Trap focus within modal dialogs
- Provide skip links for navigation
- Ensure custom components maintain focus states

```jsx
// Example of focus management in a dialog
function AccessibleDialog({ isOpen, onClose, children, title }) {
  const dialogRef = useRef(null);
  const previousFocus = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (isOpen) {
      previousFocus.current = document.activeElement;
      dialogRef.current?.focus();
    } else if (previousFocus.current) {
      previousFocus.current.focus();
    }
  }, [isOpen]);

  // Handle focus trapping...

  return isOpen ? (
    <div
      role="dialog"
      aria-modal="true"
      aria-labelledby="dialog-title"
      ref={dialogRef}
      tabIndex={-1}
    >
      <h2 id="dialog-title">{title}</h2>
      {children}
      <button onClick={onClose}>Close</button>
    </div>
  ) : null;
}
```

### Form Accessibility

Ensure forms are accessible and easy to use:

- Associate labels with form controls using `for` and `id` attributes
- Group related form elements with `fieldset` and `legend`
- Provide clear error messages and validation feedback
- Support autocomplete where appropriate
- Ensure form controls have sufficient size for touch interaction

```jsx
// Example of accessible form elements
<div className="form-field">
  <label htmlFor="patient-name">Patient Name</label>
  <input
    id="patient-name"
    name="patientName"
    type="text"
    aria-required="true"
    aria-invalid={!!errors.patientName}
    aria-describedby={errors.patientName ? "name-error" : undefined}
  />
  {errors.patientName && (
    <div id="name-error" className="error-message" role="alert">
      {errors.patientName}
    </div>
  )}
</div>
```

### Responsive and Adaptable Design

Ensure interfaces adapt to different devices, screen sizes, and user preferences:

- Support text resizing up to 200% without loss of functionality
- Ensure interfaces work in both portrait and landscape orientations
- Support browser zoom and text-only zoom
- Respect user preferences for reduced motion and color schemes

```css
/* Example of respecting user preferences */
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  * {
    animation-duration: 0.001ms !important;
    transition-duration: 0.001ms !important;
  }
}

@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  :root {
    --background: 222.2 84% 4.9%;
    --foreground: 210 40% 98%;
    /* Other dark mode variables */
  }
}
```

## Testing and Validation

### Automated Testing

Implement automated accessibility testing as part of the development process:

- Integrate tools like axe-core, jest-axe, or Lighthouse into CI/CD pipelines
- Set up automated tests for keyboard navigation
- Implement visual regression testing for contrast issues

```jsx
// Example of accessibility testing with jest-axe
import { render } from '@testing-library/react';
import { axe, toHaveNoViolations } from 'jest-axe';

expect.extend(toHaveNoViolations);

test('Button component has no accessibility violations', async () => {
  const { container } = render(<Button>Click Me</Button>);
  const results = await axe(container);
  expect(results).toHaveNoViolations();
});
```

### Manual Testing

Perform regular manual testing with assistive technologies:

- Test with screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
- Test with keyboard-only navigation
- Test with screen magnifiers
- Test with speech recognition software
- Test with high contrast modes

### User Testing

Conduct accessibility testing with users who have disabilities:

- Include users with various disabilities in usability testing
- Gather feedback from healthcare professionals with disabilities
- Test with older adults and patients with temporary impairments

## Documentation and Resources

### Component Documentation

Ensure accessibility information is included in component documentation:

- Document keyboard interactions for each component
- Provide ARIA attributes and their expected values
- Include accessibility considerations and best practices
- Document known limitations and workarounds

### Training Resources

Provide resources for team members to learn about accessibility:

- Internal workshops and training sessions
- Recommended external resources and courses
- Accessibility checklists and review processes
