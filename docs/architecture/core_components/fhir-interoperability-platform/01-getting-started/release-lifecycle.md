# FHIR Interoperability Platform Release Lifecycle

## Introduction

This document outlines the release lifecycle of the FHIR Interoperability Platform, including versioning strategy, release planning, and change management processes. Understanding this lifecycle is essential for planning upgrades, managing dependencies, and ensuring smooth operations of systems built on the platform.

## Lifecycle Stages

### Planning

The planning stage involves identifying requirements, prioritizing features, and creating a roadmap for future releases.

**Key Activities:**
- Requirements gathering from stakeholders
- Prioritization of features and enhancements
- Roadmap development and timeline estimation
- Resource allocation and planning

**Deliverables:**
- Release roadmap
- Feature prioritization matrix
- Resource allocation plan

### Development

The development stage involves implementing new features, enhancements, and bug fixes according to the release plan.

**Key Activities:**
- Feature implementation
- Code reviews
- Unit and integration testing
- Documentation updates

**Deliverables:**
- Feature-complete code
- Updated unit and integration tests
- Updated documentation

### Testing

The testing stage involves comprehensive validation of the release to ensure quality, performance, and compliance with FHIR standards.

**Key Activities:**
- Functional testing
- Performance testing
- Security testing
- Compliance testing with FHIR standards
- Regression testing

**Deliverables:**
- Test reports
- Performance benchmarks
- Compliance validation reports

### Release

The release stage involves finalizing the release, creating release artifacts, and deploying to production environments.

**Key Activities:**
- Release candidate creation
- Final validation
- Release notes preparation
- Deployment to production
- Announcement to stakeholders

**Deliverables:**
- Release artifacts (Docker images, NPM packages)
- Release notes
- Deployment documentation

### Maintenance

The maintenance stage involves supporting the released version, addressing issues, and providing patches as needed.

**Key Activities:**
- Bug fixes and patches
- Security updates
- Performance optimizations
- Minor enhancements

**Deliverables:**
- Patch releases
- Updated documentation
- Support resources

### Deprecation

The deprecation stage involves phasing out support for older versions and guiding users to newer versions.

**Key Activities:**
- Deprecation announcements
- Migration guides creation
- End-of-life planning
- Archive management

**Deliverables:**
- Deprecation notices
- Migration guides
- Archive of deprecated versions

## Versioning Strategy

The FHIR Interoperability Platform follows semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) to clearly communicate the nature of changes in each release.

### Version Numbering

- **Major Version (X.0.0)**: Incremented for incompatible API changes or significant architectural changes that require migration efforts. Major versions may introduce breaking changes to APIs, data models, or core functionality.

- **Minor Version (0.X.0)**: Incremented for new functionality added in a backward-compatible manner. Minor versions add features without breaking existing functionality.

- **Patch Version (0.0.X)**: Incremented for backward-compatible bug fixes, security updates, or minor improvements that don't add new functionality.

### FHIR Version Compatibility

In addition to semantic versioning, each release specifies compatibility with FHIR specification versions:

- **FHIR R4 (v4.0.1)**: Current primary supported FHIR version
- **FHIR R5**: Planned for future support

## Release Planning

### Release Cadence

- **Major Releases**: Approximately once per year
- **Minor Releases**: Quarterly (every 3 months)
- **Patch Releases**: As needed for critical fixes, typically within 2-4 weeks of issue identification

### Release Planning Process

1. **Roadmap Development**: Annual roadmap planning to align with organizational goals and healthcare industry trends
2. **Quarterly Planning**: Detailed planning for features in upcoming minor releases
3. **Sprint Planning**: Two-week sprints for implementation of planned features
4. **Release Readiness**: Go/no-go decision based on quality metrics and testing results

## Change Management

### Change Request Process

1. **Submission**: Change requests submitted via GitHub issues or internal ticketing system
2. **Triage**: Initial assessment for feasibility, priority, and impact
3. **Approval**: Review and approval by the change advisory board
4. **Implementation**: Development and testing of approved changes
5. **Validation**: Verification that changes meet requirements and quality standards
6. **Deployment**: Controlled release of changes to production

### Breaking Changes Policy

- Breaking changes are only introduced in major versions
- Deprecation notices are provided at least one minor version before removal
- Migration guides are provided for all breaking changes
- Backward compatibility layers are maintained when feasible

## Release Approval

### Approval Criteria

- All functional tests passing
- Performance benchmarks meeting or exceeding targets
- Security vulnerabilities addressed
- Documentation complete and accurate
- FHIR compliance validated

### Approval Process

1. **Release Candidate Creation**: Build and tag release candidate
2. **Quality Assurance**: Comprehensive testing of release candidate
3. **Stakeholder Review**: Review by key stakeholders
4. **Final Approval**: Sign-off by product owner and technical lead
5. **Release Authorization**: Final authorization for production deployment

## Rollback Procedures

In case of critical issues discovered after release:

1. **Issue Identification**: Monitoring systems alert to potential issues
2. **Impact Assessment**: Determine severity and scope of impact
3. **Decision Point**: Decide between hotfix or rollback based on impact
4. **Rollback Execution**: If needed, revert to previous stable version
5. **Communication**: Notify affected users of the issue and resolution
6. **Root Cause Analysis**: Identify cause and implement preventive measures

## Release Communication

### Communication Channels

- Release notes in GitHub repository
- Email notifications to registered users
- Microsoft Teams announcements in dedicated channel
- Documentation updates on platform portal
- Webinars for major releases

### Communication Timeline

- **Major Releases**: Announcement 3 months before, reminders at 2 months, 1 month, and 2 weeks
- **Minor Releases**: Announcement 1 month before, reminder 1 week before
- **Patch Releases**: Announcement upon release
