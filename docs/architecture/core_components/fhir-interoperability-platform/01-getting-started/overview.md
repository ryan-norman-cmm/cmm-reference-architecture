# FHIR Interoperability Platform Overview

## Introduction

The FHIR Interoperability Platform is a core component of the CMM Technology Platform, providing standardized storage, access, and exchange of healthcare data using the HL7 FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) standard. Built with TypeScript and modern cloud-native technologies, this platform delivers a comprehensive interoperability solution with robust APIs, scalable data persistence, role-based access control, real-time subscription capabilities, and implementation guide support.

Our implementation leverages TypeScript for type safety, containerized microservices for scalability, and cloud-native patterns for resilience. The platform supports FHIR R4 (v4.0.1) with a focus on healthcare data interoperability in distributed cloud environments.

### Quick Start

1. Begin with the [Setup Guide](setup-guide.md) to configure your environment
2. Set up secure access with [FHIR RBAC](../02-core-functionality/rbac.md)

## Reference Architecture

The FHIR Interoperability Platform consists of several key components working together to provide a comprehensive healthcare interoperability solution:

1. **FHIR Server Core**: Implements the FHIR REST API specification
2. **Persistence Layer**: Manages data storage and retrieval
3. **RBAC Engine**: Controls access to FHIR resources
4. **Subscription Service**: Manages topics and subscriptions
5. **Implementation Guide Manager**: Handles IG installation and validation

These components are designed to work together seamlessly while allowing for flexible deployment options to meet various organizational needs.

## Integration Points

The FHIR Interoperability Platform integrates with other core components of the CMM Technology Platform:

- **Security and Access Framework**: For authentication and authorization
- **API Marketplace**: For API discovery and management
- **Event Broker**: For event-driven architectures
- **Federated Graph API**: For unified data access
