# Architectural Principles

This section outlines the core principles that guide our architectural decisions.

### Connectivity
Our architecture prioritizes seamless data exchange across healthcare systems through unified APIs and event-driven patterns. This approach enables real-time processing capabilities while minimizing integration complexity with partners, creating comprehensive visibility into the patient journey.

### Standardization
We embrace healthcare industry standards like FHIR and Implementation Guides from HL7 and Da Vinci. This commitment to standardization ensures interoperability with partners, regulatory compliance, and reduces the burden of custom integrations while enabling us to leverage market solutions.

### Reusability
We emphasize creating reusable components that can be composed to support diverse healthcare workflows. This principle reduces redundant implementation efforts and allows teams to leverage common capabilities while maintaining their focus on areas of strategic differentiation.

### Developer Effectiveness
Our platform provides a developer experience that balances productivity with flexibility. Through comprehensive documentation, consistent patterns, and self-service capabilities, we enable teams to build solutions rapidly while maintaining quality and compliance, reducing the cognitive load for implementing complex healthcare workflows.

### Portability
Our platform establishes clear boundaries between components through standardized interfaces, creating natural "seams" where systems can safely evolve. This approach enables gradual modernization, reduces risk when making changes, supports parallel development, and fosters innovation.

### Data Fidelity
We maintain consistent, accurate healthcare data representation using FHIR as our canonical data model. This ensures semantic interoperability and data quality while preserving meaning across diverse systems and enabling reliable exchange of clinical information.

### Patient-Centered Design
Our architecture prioritizes solutions that simplify patient access to medications, reduce administrative burden, and optimize the overall medication journey. Technical decisions ultimately aim to improve patient outcomes by eliminating friction in healthcare processes.

### Network First
We leverage and enhance CoverMyMeds' network advantage by prioritizing interoperability with all network participants. Our architecture strengthens connections with providers, payers, pharmacies, and pharmaceutical manufacturers while delivering differentiated value to all participants.
